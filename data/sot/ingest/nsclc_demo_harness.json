He was admitted for bilateral pneumonia and malnutrition.\n\n## Physical Exam\nThe patient is an 86-year-old, well-developed but poorly nourished male with dementia, who is a poor historian. He complains of cough and poor appetite. Pulmonary exam reveals bilateral rales and rhonchi. The cardiovascular exam is notable for an irregular rate and rhythm. His skin is pale, warm, and dry. The abdomen is non-tender and non-distended with positive bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nAxial CT of the chest demonstrates extensive bilateral pulmonary abnormalities. There are numerous, variably sized nodules and areas of consolidation throughout both lungs, more prominent on the right. These findings are superimposed on a background of severe fibrotic changes, including reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing, particularly in the lower lobes, consistent with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern. The combination is suggestive of metastatic disease in the setting of underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient is an 86-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, admitted for pneumonia and malnutrition. Labs were significant for leukocytosis (WBC 17.7) and hypoalbuminemia (Alb 2.8). Blood cultures were negative, but a respiratory culture grew Candida. A bronchoscopy confirmed a new diagnosis of metastatic Squamous Cell Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is an 86-year-old male.\n\n## Missing Info\nInformation not available in the provided record includes smoking history, cancer stage, and performance status (e.g., ECOG).",

His past medical history was unremarkable. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3.6 × 2.8 cm pulmonary lesion in the left upper lobe, with a clear boundary and heterogeneous contrast enhancement (Fig. ). Positron emission tomography (PET) showed an accumulation of 18F-fluorodexyglucose (FDG) with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 4.95 in the early phase and 6.31 in the late phase in the nodule. No accumulation of FDG was noted in the pulmonary hilum, or mediastinal lymph nodes.\\nA trans-bronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) of the mass in the left upper lobe was performed; it revealed non-small cell carcinoma. Although the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 52.1 ng/mL (normal range 0–5.0 ng/mL), there were no distant metastases or other cancer lesions. The preoperative clinical diagnosis of primary lung cancer, stage cT2aN0M0 stage IB was considered.\\nA left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection were performed by video-assisted thoracic surgery. The resected tumor measured 3.8 × 2.8 × 2.8 cm in diameter.\\nGrossly, the specimen showed a well-established boundary as a grayish lesion with areas of necrosis. The histopathological examination showed a solid proliferation of columnar atypical cells with cell cytoplasm and complex glandular structures with abundant desmoplastic stroma, a morphological resemblance to fetal lung and significant tumor necrosis (Fig. , ). Conventional lung adenocarcinoma, another histological component and morulae were not found. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining demonstrated glycogen in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells. Stains for mucin were negative. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for AE1/AE3, CEA, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (focal) (Fig. ). Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), chromogranin A, synaptophysin, CD56, and p40 were negative. The beta-catenin result was positive, predominantly in the cell membrane (Fig. ). The final histopathological diagnosis was H-FLAC.\\nBoth lymphatic and vascular invasion were detected. Microscopically, all margins were free and mediastinal lymph nodes (#5) showed metastasis. The final pathological staging was stage IIIA (pT2aN2M0). Both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements were negative. The expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) (Dako, clone 22C3) by resected specimen was negative.\\nThe patient received cisplatin plus vinorelbine as adjuvant chemotherapy, but it was canceled at two courses because of the dehydration and hyperglycemia induced by the chemotherapy. At 25 months after the surgery, the patient had relapsed pleural dissemination. Postoperative serum CEA and AFP was 1.5 and 3.7 ng/mL, respectively. But, serum CEA at the time of relapse was 132.4 ng/mL, and AFP was unfortunately not searched.\n\nAge: [[63.0, 'year']]\nGender: M\nPMID: 29974291",
      "profile_text": "## Clinical History\nA 63-year-old Japanese man with a greater than 45 pack-year smoking history was found to have an abnormal shadow in the left middle lung field on a routine chest X-ray. His past medical history was unremarkable. A trans-bronchial lung biopsy of the mass, located in the left upper lobe, revealed non-small cell carcinoma. His serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was elevated at 52.1 ng/mL. The preoperative clinical diagnosis was primary lung cancer, stage cT2aN0M0 (Stage IB).\n\n## Physical Exam\nNo physical examination findings were mentioned in the provided text.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nA chest X-ray revealed an abnormal shadow in the left middle lung field. A subsequent chest CT scan showed a 3.6 × 2.8 cm pulmonary lesion in the left upper lobe with a clear boundary and heterogeneous contrast enhancement. A PET scan demonstrated FDG accumulation in the nodule with an SUV max of 4.95 in the early phase and 6.31 in the late phase. No FDG accumulation was observed in the pulmonary hilum or mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient underwent a left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. The final histopathological diagnosis was H-FLAC. Pathological examination revealed a resected tumor size of 3.8 × 2.8 × 2.8 cm, with lymphatic and vascular invasion present. Metastasis was found in mediastinal lymph nodes (#5), leading to a final pathological staging of pT2aN2M0 (Stage IIIA). Biomarker testing was negative for EGFR mutations, ALK gene rearrangements, and PD-L1 expression. The patient received two courses of adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin plus vinorelbine), which was discontinued due to side effects. He experienced a relapse with pleural dissemination 25 months after surgery.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is a 63-year-old Japanese man.\n\n## Missing Info\nAll required fields were populated from the provided text.",

His medications included gabapentin 300 mg four times a day for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, erlotinib 150 mg once daily for epidermal growth factor receptor- (EGFR-) positive lung adenocarcinoma, and omeprazole 40 mg once daily for subjective gastroesophageal reflux disease. A screening magnetic resonance image of the head revealed a new hypovascular pituitary mass measuring approximately 1 cm by 0.8 cm ().\\nOn examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. On physical exam, xeroderma was appreciated in all extremities. Finger size was proportional and no prognathism, acromegaly, or Cushingoid features were appreciated. The cardiopulmonary exam was normal.\\nInitial lab values demonstrated normal free triiodothyronine (T3) of 2.4 pg/mL (normal range (NR) 1.8–4.2 pg/mL), normal T3 of 86 ng/dL (NR 70–172 ng/dL), and normal free thyroxine of 1.00 ng/dL (NR 0.84–1.68 ng/dL). Prolactin was elevated at 28.9 ng/mL (NR 2.5–17.0 ng/mL). The patient's morning cortisol was immeasurably low at <1.0 mcg/dL (NR > 10 mcg/dL) as was the patient's testosterone level at <20 ng/dL (280–1100 ng/dL). Luteinizing hormone was low at 0.05 mIU/mL (NR 1.8–12.0 mIU/L).\\nThe patient was started on prednisone 20 mg by mouth daily, at which point he noticed immediate improvement in his energy and appetite as well as decrease in his nausea. For chronic steroid replacement therapy, the patient's treatment was changed from prednisone to hydrocortisone 20 mg of hydrocortisone in the morning and 10 mg in the evening. The patient was additionally instructed about the dangers of adrenal crisis and told to increase his hydrocortisone to 90 mg daily if acutely ill.\\nWithin a month of initial diagnoses, the patient suffered acute visual bilateral field cut and loss of peripheral vision. A repeat MRI demonstrated rapid enlargement of his pituitary mass, nearly doubled in size and described as a 2.2 cm by 1.2 cm mass impinging on the overlying optic chiasm ().\\nThe patient subsequently underwent transsphenoidal resection of his pituitary mass. Gross histology characterized the mass as firm and fibrous. Macroscopic analysis revealed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma described as adenohypophysis fibrosis. Further histologic analysis revealed positive identification of cytokeratin 7, TTF-1, Ki-67, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive with EGFR gene nucleotide change demonstrating T790M and L858R positivity. This histopathology demonstrated further EGFR mutation of the patient's known history of lung adenocarcinoma which initially was only positive for EGFR mutation L585R.\\nAfter transsphenoidal resection and subsequent whole-brain radiation, further results demonstrated a continued low morning cortisol at <1.0 mcg/dL (NR > 10 mcg/dL) and testosterone level at <20 ng/dL (280–1100 ng/dL). Luteinizing hormone was low at <0.1 mIU/mL (NR 1.8–12.0 mIU/L) as was follicle-stimulating hormone 0.8 mIU/mL (NR 1.5–12.4 mIU/mL).
