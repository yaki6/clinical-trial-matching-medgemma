    "correct": true,
    "reasoning": "The criterion requires adequate cardiac function, noting that patients with a cardiac history need cardiology review. The patient note (sentences 0-5) describes the patient's demographics, smoking/drinking history, symptoms of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing progressing from solids to liquids, located at the lower sternum), and weight loss. The note does not mention any history of cardiac conditions (myocardial infarction, heart failure, coronary artery disease) or any current cardiac status. Therefore, we cannot determine if the patient has adequate cardiac function or if a cardiology review is needed based solely on this note.",
