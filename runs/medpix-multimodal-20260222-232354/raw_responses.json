The stomach is markedly distended with air, forming a large central gas-filled structure. This causes significant mass effect, resulting in the anterior displacement of the heart against the sternum and narrowing of the retrosternal space.\n*   **Lungs and Pleura:** The herniated contents cause significant compression of the lung parenchyma. The left lung is severely compressed and appears largely atelectatic with associated consolidation, which may represent either compressive atelectasis or superimposed aspiration/pneumonia. A small to moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion is present. The right lung is relatively well-aerated but shows displacement and some compressive changes medially.\n*   **Osseous Structures:** The visualized portions of the thoracic spine and ribs appear intact, though there is some age-related demineralization.\n*   **Normal Anatomy Comparison:** In a normal CT, the stomach would be located entirely below the diaphragm in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.

This could be a complication of an underlying aneurysm or a primary aortic pathology.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nThis is a single slice of a CT angiogram. To fully evaluate the patient, a complete CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis would be necessary to assess the extent of the aortic abnormality, rule out other potential causes, and evaluate for complications such as branch vessel involvement or end-organ ischemia. Further evaluation with MRI or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may also be considered.\n",

The mass is confluent and relatively homogenous in attenuation.\n- **Vascular Encasement:** The mass encases the great vessels, including the aortic arch and its branches (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries are partially visualized and surrounded). The superior vena cava is also likely compressed or encased by the mass.\n- **Airway:** The trachea is slightly displaced posteriorly and to the right, though it remains patent at this level.\n- **Associated Findings:** No significant pleural or pericardial effusions are identified on this single axial slice. The visualized portions of the lung parenchyma appear clear within the limits of the mediastinal window. The osseous structures of the thorax, including the sternum and vertebrae, appear unremarkable.\n- **Clinical Correlation:** The bulky mediastinal adenopathy in a young female with pruritus and B-symptoms (weight loss, night sweats) is highly characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma, specifically the nodular sclerosis subtype.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL:\n1. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** (e.g., Primary Mediastinal Large B-cell Lymphoma): Often presents similarly as a large anterior mediastinal mass in young adults, though pruritus is more specific for Hodgkin lymphoma.\n2. **Germ Cell Tumor** (e.g., Seminoma or Teratoma): Less likely given the patient's gender and classic constitutional symptoms, but remains a consideration for large anterior mediastinal masses.\n3. **Thymic Neoplasm** (e.g., Thymoma): Usually occurs in a slightly older age group and is less likely to present with such extensive \"B-symptoms\" and pruritus.",
