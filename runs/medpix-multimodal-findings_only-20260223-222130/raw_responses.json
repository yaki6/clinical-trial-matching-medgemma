This finding consists of an outer bowel wall encompassing an inner segment of bowel and associated mesenteric fat. The walls of the involved bowel segments appear thickened.\n*   **Contrast Distribution:** Hyperdense (bright) oral or rectal contrast is present within several loops of bowel throughout the abdomen. Some segments of bowel are also filled with gas.\n\n**Associated and Normal Structures:**\n*   **Musculature:** The psoas muscles and paraspinal (erector spinae) muscles are symmetric and robust. The abdominal wall musculature, including the rectus abdominis and oblique muscles, appears unremarkable.\n*   **Vasculature:** The abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava are visualized anterior to the vertebral body. They appear normal in caliber and configuration for this level.\n*   **Bony Structures:** A single lumbar vertebral body is visualized. The marrow density is within normal limits, and the cortex is intact.

The lesion may consist of three layers: at the cortical surface it is dense and compact, it has a middle layer of amorphous dense bone, and the outer layer there are dense spicules extending into the periphery. These tumors typically have a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.  The lesion may eventually progress to cortical destruction and medullary invasion, MRI can be used to grade the extent of tumor extension and cortical disruption.",

This collection demonstrates intermediate T1 signal (brighter than CSF, but darker than fat). \n    *   This collection causes significant anterior displacement and narrowing of the thecal sac. \n    *   The spinal cord itself appears to have an intrinsically normal signal throughout the visualized extent, though its space within the canal is markedly reduced in the thoracic region.\n*   **Paraspinal Soft Tissues:** \n    *   There is diffuse thickening and loss of normal fat planes in the prevertebral and paraspinal soft tissues adjacent to the abnormal vertebrae. \n    *   Ill-defined, intermediate T1 signal is visible in the paraspinal musculature and prevertebral space, particularly in the thoracic region.\n*   **Alignment:** There is a relative straightening of the normal cervical lordosis. The overall alignment of the thoracic and lumbar spine is maintained on this single sagittal slice.\n*   **Normal Structures:** The upper cervical vertebral bodies (C1-C4) show expected high T1 marrow signal.
