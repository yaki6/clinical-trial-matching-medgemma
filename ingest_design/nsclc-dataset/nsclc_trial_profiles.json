A subsequent PET scan revealed increased uptake in the right lung, where a history of stable pulmonary nodules existed since 2003. The patient was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the right lung. Past medical history is significant for nephrolithiasis and hyperlipidemia. Past surgical history includes a benign right neck lymph node resection and a cholecystectomy. The patient has a 20-year smoking history of over one pack per day. There is a strong family history of cancer, with three sisters dying of lung cancer and a brother diagnosed with head and neck cancer.\n\n## Physical Exam\nPhysical examination findings were not provided in the clinical notes.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nDirect analysis of axial CT images reveals a large, irregular soft tissue mass in the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe, appearing pleural-based with associated right hilar adenopathy. An additional large, heterogeneous soft tissue mass is present within the right gluteal musculature. A possible low-density lesion is noted in the right adrenal gland. The provided EHR text notes progression of these findings over time, as well as rib destruction, endobronchial narrowing, and mesenteric masses.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the right lung.

He was admitted for bilateral pneumonia and malnutrition.\n\n## Physical Exam\nThe patient is an 86-year-old, well-developed but poorly nourished male with dementia, who is a poor historian. He complains of cough and poor appetite. Pulmonary exam reveals bilateral rales and rhonchi. The cardiovascular exam is notable for an irregular rate and rhythm. His skin is pale, warm, and dry. The abdomen is non-tender and non-distended with positive bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nAxial CT of the chest demonstrates extensive bilateral pulmonary abnormalities. There are numerous, variably sized nodules and areas of consolidation throughout both lungs, more prominent on the right. These findings are superimposed on a background of severe fibrotic changes, including reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing, particularly in the lower lobes, consistent with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern. The combination is suggestive of metastatic disease in the setting of underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient is an 86-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, admitted for pneumonia and malnutrition. Labs were significant for leukocytosis (WBC 17.7) and hypoalbuminemia (Alb 2.8). Blood cultures were negative, but a respiratory culture grew Candida. A bronchoscopy confirmed a new diagnosis of metastatic Squamous Cell Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is an 86-year-old male.\n\n## Missing Info\nInformation not available in the provided record includes smoking history, cancer stage, and performance status (e.g., ECOG).",

Other significant past medical history includes a stroke in 1988 with residual dysarthria, impaired cognition, and abnormal gait. Comorbidities include hyperlipidemia, chronic congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension. The patient received chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Paclitaxel for the lung cancer. Other medications include Simvastatin, Furosemide, Metformin, Lisinopril, and Insulin.\n\n## Physical Exam\nNo detailed physical examination findings are provided in the record. Laboratory observations from September 1993 include a body weight of 104.9 kg, an elevated NT-proBNP of 1137.4 pg/mL, and blood counts within relatively normal limits (Leukocytes 9.8 10*3/uL, Erythrocytes 4.1 10*6/uL, Hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL).\n\n## Imaging Findings\nDirect analysis of the provided chest X-ray reveals a large, irregular, spiculated mass in the right upper lobe, highly suspicious for a primary lung malignancy. The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged. No definite large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient was diagnosed with Non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, TNM stage 1, and was undergoing treatment with chemotherapy (Cisplatin and Paclitaxel). The patient's multiple comorbidities, including CHF, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, were also being managed medically. The final entry in the record is a Death Certification on November 4, 1993, with the cause of death listed as Non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n## Demographics\nAge and sex are not specified in the provided medical record.\n\n## Missing Info\nPatient age and sex could not be determined from the provided information.",

      "profile_text": "## Clinical History\nA 65-year-old female was diagnosed in 2017 with stage IIA non-small cell adenocarcinoma of the right middle lobe. She underwent a right middle lobectomy and mediastinal node dissection, followed by adjuvant carboplatin/Alimta chemotherapy. In January 2019, a relapse was detected with multiple nodular masses in the right lower lobe. She received palliative chemotherapy (carboplatin, taxol, and pembrolizumab) followed by pembrolizumab maintenance. The nodules resolved by October 2019. In March 2020, she developed acute kidney injury with a rising creatinine level, which was diagnosed via biopsy as acute and chronic interstitial nephritis. Pembrolizumab was held and she was treated with prednisone, leading to improvement in renal function. An attempt to resume pembrolizumab resulted in a recurrence of the kidney injury, leading to its permanent discontinuation. The patient expired a few months after September 2020.\n\n## Physical Exam\nThe patient was noted to be asymptomatic with no lower extremities edema when her creatinine level began to rise.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nA chest CT in 2017 identified the primary non-small cell adenocarcinoma of the right middle lobe. A repeat chest CT in January 2019 showed multiple nodular masses in the right lower lobe, and a PET/CT scan confirmed subpleural nodules with moderate FDG activity, indicating relapse. A subsequent CT in May 2019 showed a decrease in the size of these nodules. By October 2019, a chest CT showed complete resolution of the pulmonary nodules.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient had a history of stage IIA NSCLC, treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, which later relapsed. The relapse was treated with combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy, followed by maintenance immunotherapy, which led to a complete response. However, she developed a significant adverse event, pembrolizumab-induced interstitial nephritis, requiring cessation of the immunotherapy and treatment with steroids. The decision was made to stop pembrolizumab indefinitely due to the recurrence of kidney injury upon re-challenge.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is a 65-year-old female.\n\n## Missing Info\nNo missing information for required fields was identified.",

She required a tracheotomy due to airway obstruction from a large parapharyngeal mass. Initial treatment with CHOEP chemotherapy was ineffective. Next-generation sequencing revealed MET exon 14 and MAP2K1 mutations. She was subsequently treated with radiotherapy (total 60 Gy/30 F) and the MET inhibitor crizotinib, which resulted in a partial response. Crizotinib was discontinued after two months due to financial reasons, prompting a search for new therapeutic targets via further NGS.\n\n## Physical Exam\nThe patient presented with a left neck mass and a large mass in the left parapharyngeal space, causing airway obstruction, pharyngeal pain, and dysphagia. She also experienced fever.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nA PET/CT scan revealed a large solid mass in the left parapharyngeal space compressing the pharyngeal cavity, along with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck. After 20 Gy of irradiation, the pharyngeal mass reduced from 6.0 cm x 4.4 cm to 5.6 cm x 4.0 cm, and the neck mass from 3.5 cm x 2.8 cm to 2.9 cm x 2.6 cm. After a full course of radiotherapy and one month of crizotinib, the sum of the product of the longest perpendicular dimensions (SPD) decreased by 57%.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient has histiocytic sarcoma with MET exon 14 and MAP2K1 mutations, which showed a partial response to radiotherapy and crizotinib after failing initial chemotherapy. Due to the high cost of crizotinib, the treatment was stopped. The plan is to perform further next-generation sequencing to identify new targetable therapeutic options.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is a 19-year-old female.\n\n## Missing Info\nRace, ethnicity, and specific dates for most clinical events are not provided in the text.",

He was admitted for a mass lesion in the right hilum. A bronchoscopy revealed a tumor occluding the right upper lobar bronchus and infiltrating the bronchus intermedius, which was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma via biopsy. The patient also had a coincidental diagnosis of persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC).\n\n## Physical Exam\nThe patient is a 65-year-old male. On presentation, he had no facial swelling or superficial varicose veins.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nChest contrast CT showed an 80 mm mass in the right upper lobe, directly invading the arch of the right pulmonary artery and a wide range of the superior vena cava (SVC). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated coronary sinus (21 mm) and findings consistent with a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC). Brain MRI, upper abdomen CT, and a bone scan showed no detectable distant metastases. A post-treatment chest MRI confirmed the patency of a vascular graft and the PLSVC.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient was diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung with invasion of the SVC and right pulmonary artery, and positive mediastinal lymph nodes. He underwent a right posterolateral thoracotomy with a double sleeve lobectomy of the right upper and middle lobes, along with SVC and pulmonary artery reconstruction using a PTFE graft. Postoperatively, he received anticoagulation, 4 cycles of chemotherapy (Gemcitabine and cisplatin), and 1 cycle of radiotherapy. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, but he died 21 months after the operation due to remote metastasis.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is a 65-year-old male.\n\n## Missing Info\nAll required information was available in the provided text.",

Initial workup revealed a pituitary mass and lab findings consistent with panhypopituitarism, including low cortisol, testosterone, and LH, with elevated prolactin. He was started on steroid replacement. Within a month, he developed acute bilateral visual field cuts and loss of peripheral vision, corresponding to a rapid enlargement of the pituitary mass.\n\n## Physical Exam\nOn examination, vital signs were within normal limits. Xeroderma was noted on all extremities. There were no signs of prognathism, acromegaly, or Cushingoid features. The cardiopulmonary exam was normal.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nAn initial screening MRI of the head revealed a new hypovascular pituitary mass measuring approximately 1 cm by 0.8 cm. A repeat MRI one month later, following acute visual changes, demonstrated rapid enlargement of the mass to 2.2 cm by 1.2 cm, with impingement on the overlying optic chiasm.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient was diagnosed with a pituitary mass, later confirmed by pathology after transsphenoidal resection to be metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The histology revealed a new EGFR T790M mutation in addition to the previously known L858R mutation. His lab results indicated adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadism, for which he was started on hydrocortisone replacement therapy.

After 5 infusions of nivolumab, she developed skin lesions, and after 20 infusions, she developed enlarging mediastinal nodes and a micronodular interstitial syndrome. Biopsies and mediastinoscopy confirmed a sarcoid-like reaction (SLR) with no evidence of tumor, infection, or foreign bodies. Nivolumab was discontinued. Despite the SLR, the patient had a partial response to treatment for her NSCLC per RECIST criteria.\n\n## Physical Exam\nThe patient is a 56-year-old female. Skin lesions appeared after 5 nivolumab infusions and decreased 155 days after discontinuation of the drug.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nA CT scan after 5 nivolumab infusions suggested a partial response. After 20 infusions, imaging showed an increase in mediastinal node size and a micronodular interstitial syndrome. A follow-up CT scan 348 days after stopping nivolumab showed normal mediastinal nodes and regression of the interstitial syndrome.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient has unresectable NSCLC with a partial response to nivolumab. However, she developed a significant immune-related adverse event in the form of a sarcoid-like reaction, which led to the discontinuation of nivolumab. The SLR involved the skin, mediastinal lymph nodes, and lungs. The plan involved stopping immunotherapy, after which the SLR showed gradual resolution over several months.

His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and a smoking history of one pack per day. His family history is notable for lung adenocarcinoma. He recently traveled to Yunnan, China. An initial course of oral azithromycin for suspected infiltration on chest X-ray was ineffective.\n\n## Physical Exam\nPhysical examination was unremarkable except for fine crackles over bilateral lung fields on chest auscultation. The patient was afebrile with a smooth respiratory pattern. Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95% on ambient air.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nInitial chest X-ray demonstrated increased infiltration over bilateral lung fields, later described as diffuse interstitial infiltration. A subsequent chest CT revealed extensive patchy ground-glass opacities with thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines, creating a \u201ccrazy paving\u201d pattern. A radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) showed a \u201cblizzard sign,\u201d suggestive of ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nWorkup for respiratory decline revealed normal white blood cell count and negative autoimmune markers. Sputum cultures and PCR were negative for common pathogens, including Pneumocystis jiroveci. Pulmonary function tests showed normal spirometry but a moderately reduced DLCO (57.7% of predicted). Bronchoscopy with BAL, brush cytology, and biopsies (forceps and cryobiopsy) was performed for further investigation. Microbiological analysis of the BAL was negative. The patient is awaiting the final pathological diagnosis from the biopsy specimens.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is a 54-year-old male.\n\n## Missing Info\nThe definitive primary diagnosis is not available as the pathological report from the biopsy is not included in the provided text.",

The preoperative clinical diagnosis was primary lung cancer, stage cT2aN0M0 (Stage IB).\n\n## Physical Exam\nNo physical examination findings were mentioned in the provided text.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nA chest X-ray revealed an abnormal shadow in the left middle lung field. A subsequent chest CT scan showed a 3.6 \u00d7 2.8 cm pulmonary lesion in the left upper lobe with a clear boundary and heterogeneous contrast enhancement. A PET scan demonstrated FDG accumulation in the nodule with an SUV max of 4.95 in the early phase and 6.31 in the late phase. No FDG accumulation was observed in the pulmonary hilum or mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient underwent a left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. The final histopathological diagnosis was H-FLAC. Pathological examination revealed a resected tumor size of 3.8 \u00d7 2.8 \u00d7 2.8 cm, with lymphatic and vascular invasion present. Metastasis was found in mediastinal lymph nodes (#5), leading to a final pathological staging of pT2aN2M0 (Stage IIIA). Biomarker testing was negative for EGFR mutations, ALK gene rearrangements, and PD-L1 expression. The patient received two courses of adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin plus vinorelbine), which was discontinued due to side effects. He experienced a relapse with pleural dissemination 25 months after surgery.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is a 63-year-old Japanese man.\n\n## Missing Info\nAll required fields were populated from the provided text.",
