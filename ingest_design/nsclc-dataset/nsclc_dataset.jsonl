The pleural effusion may be secondary to metastatic adenocarcinoma, malignant mesothelioma, or less commonly invasive thymoma, or in a patient with AIDS, Kaposi sarcoma.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma accounts for 95% of cases of pleural thickening with effusion, while mesothelioma is a relatively rare cause with approximately 5% of cases.  Lung, and breast adenocarcinomas most frequently metastasize to the pleura.  Other tumors, such as lymphoma, colon, pancreas, kidney, or ovarian are other diagnostic considerations. Until thoracocentesis or pleural biopsy is performed, mesothelioma or metastatic disease cannot be distinguished.\n\nCT is more advantageous over chest radiography in evaluating nodular pleural thickening.

Other associations include radiation exposure, asbestos exposure, occupational inhaled substances (especially nickel, chromates, and arsenic), genetically dominant oncogenes, and loss of tumor suppressor genes.\n\nDemographics (Age, Sex, Incidence): Cancer of the lung occurs most often between the ages of 40 and 70, with a peak incidence in the 6th or 7th decade. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes and the male:female death ratio is about 3:1. The annual death rate for lung cancer is about 70/100,000 for males and 19/100,000 for females.\n\nCommon Locations: Bronchogenic cancers arise most often as a hilar mass but may also present as a large peripheral mass.\n\nGross Appearance: The neoplastic tissue is typically gray-white and firm to hard.  Bulky tumors often have areas of necrosis that appear yellow-white and mottling. \n\nHistology: Histology varies depending on the subtype: adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype and features include gland formation, mucin production, and often an adjacent desmoplastic response.  Other subtypes include squamous cell carcinomas, small cell carcinomas, and large cell carcinomas.\n\nSpecial Stains: Mucicarmine, Cytokeratin 7, Cytokeratin 20, and TTF -1.\n\nRadiology: Plain chest films may show single or multiple nodules, well defined or poorly defined masses in the hilar or peripheral regions or no findings. Mediastinal enlargement may be evident due to primary tumor or metastatic lymphadenopathy.  CT may show an irregular or spiculated edge due to fibrosis surrounding the tumor, a lobulated contour, air bronchograms within the nodule, or cavitation. 95% of lung nodules exceeding 2 cm are cancers. \nOf particular significance for this case is the radiologic appearance of lung cancer metastases to the liver. A liver met will typically appear as a well-defined, low-density, solid mass with vague peripheral enhancement.  The mass will often appear hypodense centrally due to tumor necrosis.  Calcifications may be present. Multiple masses or diffusely infiltrating metastases may also occur.   \n\nProgression: Bronchogenic CA spreads by direct invasion or via the hematogeneous or lympahngitic routes.  Mediastinal nodes are commonly involved, and distal mets to the liver, brain, bone, and adrenals are common.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: Overall prognosis is approximately 9% 5 year survival. Small-cell carcinoma has a median survival rate of 12-18 months and is treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Non-small cell cancers are treated surgically if disease is limited.

Common symptoms include dyspnea, jugular venous distention, and edema of the face and upper extremities. The most common cause is malignancy. In cases of SVC syndrome secondary to malignancy, 90% are caused by either bronchogenic carcinoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Around 2-4% of all lung cancer patients will develop SVC syndrome at some point during their disease course. While Hodgkin's lymphoma is known for mediastinal lymphadenopathy, it rarely causes SVC syndrome.\n\nThere are multiple other non-malignant etiologies. Patients with indwelling intravascular catheters can develop thrombosis resulting in obstruction of the vessel. Fibrosing mediastinitis can result in an excessive fibrotic reaction in the mediastinum that can affect multiple structures within this compartment, to include the SVC. Excessive radiation can cause a similar response, with fibrosis of the vessels resulting in SVC syndrome. \n\nThe severity of symptoms can vary based on the rate of occlusion. A rapid SVC occlusion may not allow enough time for systemic compensation with collateral vein formation, thus increasing the severity of symptoms. \n\nPrognosis and treatment varies greatly but is often based on the etiology of disease.  Benign causes of SVC syndrome that can resolve completely if the underlying benign disease is treated. In other cases, such as advanced malignancy, the goal of therapy is palliation, such as use of radiation therapy or vascular stent placement. In general, surgical care is not the best option. \n\nAs most cases of SVC syndrome are due to malignancy, a key question is how advanced the disease as progressed.  If tumor is infiltrating the SVC (and mediastinum), resection will not provide a cure.  In cases of advanced malignancy, the goal of therapy is palliation, such as use of radiation therapyto shrink tumor burden or vascular stent placement for symptom relief. In general, surgical care is not the best option in these cases.

{"uid": "8691080-1", "title": "Secondary myelodysplastic syndromes identified via next-generation sequencing in a non-small cell lung cancer patient", "history": "A 66-year-old male with back pain and cough for two weeks was admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing on 8 August 2019. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the malignant tumor on the left upper lobe was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the multiple bone metastases on 25 August 2019 (Fig. A). Immunohistochemical (IHC) results of the posterior iliac bone marrow biopsy specimen showed the positive expression of CD3, CD20, CD34, CD235a, and NPO, and the negative CD61 expression. IHC results of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the bronchial mucosa on the upper left lobe showed the positive expression of TTF1, CK7, NapsinA, Ki67, CK, and EMA, and the negative expression of CK5/6, P40, CgA, Syn, and CD45 on 6 September 2019. Histopathologic observations showed infiltration of atypia cells in mucosal and fibrous tissues. The detection tools of pathology and cytology included automatic IHC staining (BenchMark XT, Roche, The United States), digital slice scanner, image analysis software (Pannoramic 250, 3DHistech, Hungary), and microscope (Eclipse Ci-S, Nikon, Japan). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma combing with bone metastases.\\nTo seek potential therapeutic opportunities, the FFPE tissue and control sample (white blood cell) of the patient were detected using a 733-gene NGS panel in a College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificated lab. Sequencing reads were mapped against the hg19/GRCh37 genome, and duplicate reads were removed, followed by variants calling in targeted regions using an in-house developed bioinformatics algorithm. The algorithm utilized a filtering model containing background error correction, strand bias, base quality, mapping quality, short tandem repeat regions, and low-quality mapping ratio 25 []. The NGS analysis results indicated that the patient had an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation with an allelic fraction of 73.19% and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation. Besides, the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion were detected using NGS-based copy number variation (CNV) analyses (Fig. ), which were classical abnormalities associated with MDS. According to the clinical inquiry, the patient was a farmer by occupation, which means that he has long been exposed to certain chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and solvents containing benzene. In addition, he smoked for 40 years. Taking all these findings together, we suspected the patient with secondary MDS. The results of the physiological blood indexes and the bone marrow aspiration test showed a decrease of platelet counts and the elevation of myelocyte counts. The proportion of blast was 5%, and the morphology of the cells presented the characteristics of MDS, which further confirmed our speculation (Fig. and Additional file : Fig. S1).\\nIn terms of treatment, the EGFR-positive mutation patient was administered with gefitinib starting from 20 August 2019. Due to decreasing platelet counts, azacitidine was administrated for four courses of treatment. However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and the size of the maximal tumor in the lung lesion did not decrease after seven months’ treatment (Fig. B). On 10 April 2020, a pathological report showed the infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells into the fibrous tissue. IHC results suggested the neuroendocrine tumor, in which small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounted for about 40% and 60%, respectively. On 7 April and 28 April 2020, considering positive PD-L1 expression and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in the tissue sample, the patient was administrated with toripalimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) and bevacizumab. Platelet counts returned to near-normal levels gradually, and the tumor lesion shrank obviously (Fig. ). It was concluded that the patient reached a partial response (PR) (Fig. C).

{"uid": "8678082-1", "title": "Mixed Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma and Atypical Carcinoid: A Report of Two Cases of a Non-codified Entity With Biological Profile", "history": "On July 2008, a 59-year-old man, ex-smoker (45 packs/year), underwent upper right lung lobectomy and regional lymph adenectomy with the diagnosis of stage I (pT2, pN0) lung adenocarcinoma, solid pattern. On July 2020, the chest CT scan revealed the presence of an upper left lung lobe and two lower left lung lobe lesions. On August 2020, the patient underwent a wedge resection of the upper and the lower lung lobes lesions with N1 and N2 nodal sampling.\\nGross examination of the surgical specimens of the first atypical pulmonary resection of left inferior lobe revealed an Intraparenchymal, peripheral, solid, yellow-white lesion measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Histological assessment identified a well-circumscribed lesion composed of two different morphological components, tightly adhered but not intermingled each other. The first component represented about 60% of the whole neoplasm and was characterized by a solid and trabecular proliferation of polygonal-shaped uniform tumor cells, with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuocus nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid. Four mitosis/2 mm2 were identified, without tumoral necrosis. The second component, which represented about 40% of whole neoplasm, showed a main lepidic, non-mucinous pattern with secondary papillary architecture, corresponding to a lepidic-papillary pattern PA. Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins AE1–3 was documented in carcinoid component, while adenocarcinomatous component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins (). CK7 immunoreactivity was selectively documented in the adenocarcinomatous component. A final diagnosis of “combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid” was made. No immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 was documented in both components. TPS for PD-L1 was <1% in both components. Both two other lesions on atypical pulmonary resections of the upper left lobe and inferior left lobe showed intraparenchymal neoplasm of 1.8 and 1.5 cm, respectively, corresponding both to PA with a main solid pattern and lepidic, non-mucinous second pattern. A positivity ROS1 score of 2+ with gene rearrangement on FISH was documented in the upper pulmonary lobe neoplasia. No immunoreactivity for ALK and a PD-L1 TPS of 1%–49% were observed. No immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 with PD-L1 TPS of >50% were documented in the lower lobe neoplasia. No pleural invasion was observed. No lymph nodes metastases were found. The final UICC 2017 stage pT4 (m-3) (PL0) pN0 was assigned.\\nTargeted NGS analysis on Ion Torrent NGS platform using the Ocav3 panel was performed on DNA and RNA extracted from each microdissected histological components of the primary mixed neoplasm (I1/I2) and in the other two adenocarcinomas located in the inferior (I3) and superior (S1) left pulmonary lobes. Summary of genetic results are shown in \\n. Among a total of 161 investigated genes included in the NGS panel, both common and private somatic genes mutations were identified in each entity (). The adenocarcinoma I1 and carcinoid I2 components of the mixed neoplasm shared the same mutations in BRAF (p.Gly466Ala), NF1 (p.Pro1359LeufsTer19 and p.Glu1928Ter), STK11 (p.Gly188AlafsTer99), and AKT2 (p.Leu52Ter) genes. Four additional somatic mutations were detected in the DDR2 (p.Arg806Ter), CDK6 (p.Thr107Ser), and SMARCA4 gene (p.Arg1135Gln) were identified in the adenocarcinoma component, whereas no specific mutations were identified in the carcinoid component. A different genetic profile emerged from the molecular analysis of the two additional adenocarcinoma nodules I3 and S1, lacking those somatic mutations identified in the mixed nodules, but shared two somatic missense mutations in the KRAS (p.Gly12Asp) and NOTCH1 (p.Pro498Arg). In addition, the I3 adenocarcinoma showed a specific, somatic mutations in ATM (p.Gln1117Ter), TP53 (p.Gly245Asp), and CDK12 (p.Arg44Trp) genes, whereas the S1 adenocarcinoma showed a specific, somatic, missense mutations in IDH2 gene (p.Arg172Ser).\\nSince November 2020, considering the ROS1 positivity, the patient started crizotinib, which is still ongoing, reporting a stable disease.", "exam": "Age: [[59.0, 'year']]\nGender: M\nPMID: 34926584", "findings": "Related articles: {'25646366': 1, '25680416': 1, '29248665': 1, '24174329': 1, '9792054': 1, '23689091': 1, '28059096': 1, '28637487': 1, '26027992': 1, '33482246': 1, '27873319': 1, '21427100': 1, '34926584': 2}\nSimilar patients: {'8678082-2': 2}", "diagnosis": "", "discussion": "", "images": [], "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": [], "has_history": true, "has_findings": false, "has_diagnosis": false, "has_images": false, "is_complete": false, "dataset_source": "PMC-Patients", "nsclc_source": "PMC-Patients"}

The pathology report showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with visceral pleural invasion and transcription termination factor 1 positive. She completed carboplatin/Alimta in 2018. In January 2019, her repeat chest CT (Figure ) showed multiple nodular masses in the right lower lobe where her original lung cancer was. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan was done, which showed subpleural nodules with moderate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity, indicating relapse. At that time, she had declined a biopsy. She was started on palliative chemotherapy of carboplatin, taxol, and pembrolizumab in March 2019 and finished the regimen in May 2019. A repeat chest CT done in May 2019 showed a decreased size of her right lower lobe pulmonary nodules without evidence of progression or new distant lesions. She started pembrolizumab for maintenance therapy in June 2019. Then, her chest CT in October 2019 (Figure ) showed complete resolution of the pulmonary nodules with no evidence of progression or new lesions. However, in March 2020, her creatinine (Cr) level started to increase to 3.07 even though she was asymptomatic with no lower extremities edema. Her baseline Cr level was around 1.0-1.2. Her Cr level had increased to 5.53 in April 2020 and further workup was initiated. Her protein: Cr ratio was 1315, no monoclonal protein was identified, and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and vasculitis profile were negative. Complement levels were normal. She subsequently underwent a kidney biopsy with pathology (Figure ) showing acute and chronic interstitial nephritis grade 3 and tubulitis. Further workup with the kidney was unremarkable. Her pembrolizumab was held toward the end of March, and she was started on a prednisone 40 mg taper. Her Cr did improve to 1.19, close to her baseline, in May 2020. She completed the steroid taper in July 2020. With the improvement of her Cr, she resumed pembrolizumab in July 2020; however, her Cr level started to increase up to 2.09. She was restarted on prednisone 20 mg daily, and after discussion with oncology, a decision was made to stop pembrolizumab indefinitely. In September 2020, she was tapered down to 10 mg daily.

Histologically, HS is composed of large polygonal cells with epithelioid-to-pleomorphic morphology, abundant eosinophilic to vacuolated or foamy cytoplasm, ovoid to irregularly shaped nuclei, and variably prominent nucleoli (). For immunohistochemical markers, most HS express CD68 and CD163 and partially express S100 (). Chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and etoposide (CHOEP)) was initially started on December 8, 2017 with the aim of stabilization of the fulminate disease course; however, the lesions did not shrink and pain and dysphagia were heavier caused by the compression of the pharynx (). In order to relieve the compression, irradiation to the lesions of pharyngeal and neck was started on day 11 of chemotherapy. After irradiation of 20 Gy/10 F, the size of lesions became a little bit smaller (pharyngeal mass: from 6.0 cm × 4.4 cm to 5.6 cm × 4.0 cm; neck mass: from 3.5 cm × 2.8 cm to 2.9 cm × 2.6 cm).\\nMeantime, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue was performed using a panel of 93 genes (Gene+ OncoLym). This analysis revealed the presence of oncogenic mutation c.2888-1G>T in the MET gene, exon 14 (allele frequency, 5.58%), as well as an activated mutation c.361T>A (C121S) in the MAP2K1 gene, exon 3 (allele frequency, 17.23%). MEK inhibitor trametinib has been reported to be effective in HS patients with MAP2K1 mutation (); however, trametinib was not available in China at that time. It has been reported that patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutation-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer are sensitive to MET inhibitor crizotinib (); therefore, this histiocytic sarcoma patient began to take crizotinib (250 mg, twice daily) after irradiation of 20 Gy/10 F. Partial response (PR) was observed after radiotherapy of a total dose of 60 Gy/30 F and 1-month treatment of crizotinib, with sum of the product of the longest perpendicular dimensions (SPD) decreased by 57% (). The lesions kept shrinking () after radiotherapy, and crizotinib was still taken daily for 1 month more. However, 2-month treatment of crizotinib cost her family RMB 100,000 Yuan. The patient could no longer afford such an expensive drug.\\nIn order to search for new targetable therapeutic drugs, NGS was done again with a panel of 1,021 genes (Gene+ Onco-C1021T). The most frequently mutated genes were mutation c.410G>A (G137D) in the DUSP2 gene, exon 2 (allele frequency, 18.9%), mutation c.290G>A (C97Y) in the HIST1H3B gene, exon 1 (allele frequency, 15.9%), and mutation c.3646A>T (S1216C) in the GRIN2A gene, exon 13 (allele frequency, 15.7%). Both DUSP2 and GRIN2A are in the RET signaling pathway. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that inhibits RET, PDGFR, and KIT. It has been reported to be effective in some HS cases (). The patient was subsequently treated with imatinib (400 mg daily) and thalidomide (100 mg daily) since March 2018. The cost of imatinib and thalidomide was RMB 2,600 Yuan/month. Two months after the treatment, excellent PR was observed () compared with tumor size in March 2018. Four months later the re-evaluation by CT scans showed a nearly complete remission (CR) (). The patient took maintenance of imatinib and thalidomide for 2 years and stopped the treatment in March 2020. To date (September 2021), 45 months after HS diagnosis, she is still alive without tumor recurrence.\\nTo explore the possible underlying mechanism of imatinib plus thalidomide in this HS patient, experiments in vitro were performed in a canine HS cell line DH82. Results of cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assays showed that the proliferation activity of DH82 was significantly inhibited by imatinib but not thalidomide (). Combined thalidomide and imatinib treatment did not improve the inhibitory effects of imatinib to DH82 (). We speculated that no synergistic effect existed between imatinib and thalidomide, but each of them might have its own specific antitumor activity.\\nAs mentioned above, mutations of DUSP2 and GRIN2A are involved in the RET signaling pathway. RET signaling leads to the activation of the RAS/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways and has key roles in cell growth, differentiation, and survival (). Further KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of NGS results from patient’s tissue also revealed that PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways were activated in this HS patient (). Immunohistochemistry staining on the patient’s tissue was performed to detect phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) and phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) of MAPK pathway and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) of PI3K/AKT pathway. Results showed that p-AKT and p-ERK were strongly positive, while p-JNK was almost negative (), indicating the patient actually harbored the activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Treatment of DH82 with imatinib demonstrated that p-ERK and p-AKT were substantially inhibited with imatinib while p-JNK was slightly elevated in a dose-dependent manner, which confirmed the inhibitory effects of imatinib on DH82 by targeting activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways ().", "exam": "Age: [[19.0, 'year']]\nGender: F\nPMID: 34938656", "findings": "Related articles: {'29097496': 1, '17617785': 1, '22973956': 1, '26980727': 1, '30626916': 1, '26298731': 1, '25971938': 1, '31439678': 1, '22846978': 1, '25209580': 1, '29183888': 1, '26629225': 1, '32306194': 1, '34938656': 2}\nSimilar patients: {}", "diagnosis": "", "discussion": "", "images": [], "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": [], "has_history": true, "has_findings": false, "has_diagnosis": false, "has_images": false, "is_complete": false, "dataset_source": "PMC-Patients", "nsclc_source": "PMC-Patients"}

He presented with no face swelling and superficial varicose veins. He was a former smoker, and medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus. At bronchoscopy, the tumor was found occluding the right upper lobar bronchus and infiltrating the bronchus intermedius. It was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma by transbronchial tumor biopsy. Chest contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed that the mass of 80 mm in the maximum diameter located in the right upper lobe. The tumor directly invaded the arch of the right PA and a wide range of SVC. It was discovered that the left brachiocephalic vein (BCV) along the left margin of mediastinum walking down the line directly into the coronary sinus (). A venous flow was detected in the anterolateral descending aorta with dilatation of the coronary sinus (diameter of 21 mm) without other heart abnormalities by transthoracic echocardiography. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PLSVC was made. There were no detectable metastases in other organs through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), upper abdomen CT scan and bone nuclear scan.\\nThe right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed on October 31, 2006. As expected, the tumor invaded the wall of SVC and no left brachial cephalic vein bifurcation was observed. The SVC was separated, clamped and resected following intravenous injection of 5, 000 IU of sodium heparin. The ringed PTFE graft of 12 mm in diameter was interpositioned between the right brachial cephalic vein and the origin of SVC by running sutures with 4-0 polypropylene. The tumor resection was completed by double sleeve lobectomy of right upper and middle lobes. The anastomosis between the right main bronchus and the cut end of the lower lobe bronchus was performed by interrupted suture using 3-0 Vicryl (Ethicon, USA). Right PA trunk and right lower PA reconstruction was completed by the running suture with 4-0 polypropylene (). And systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. All excised margins were tested microscopically negative for malignancy. As anticoagulation treatment, we began with low molecular Heparin on the operative day, then switched and continued to warfarin when thoracic drains removed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the 12th postoperative day. Final pathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma invaded the right SVC, right PA and mediastinal nodes were positive for malignancy.\\nAfter 4 cycles of chemotherapy (Gemzar and cisplatin) and 1 cycle of radiotherapy, Chest MRI showed patency of the graft and PLSVC ().

His medications included gabapentin 300 mg four times a day for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, erlotinib 150 mg once daily for epidermal growth factor receptor- (EGFR-) positive lung adenocarcinoma, and omeprazole 40 mg once daily for subjective gastroesophageal reflux disease. A screening magnetic resonance image of the head revealed a new hypovascular pituitary mass measuring approximately 1 cm by 0.8 cm ().\\nOn examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. On physical exam, xeroderma was appreciated in all extremities. Finger size was proportional and no prognathism, acromegaly, or Cushingoid features were appreciated. The cardiopulmonary exam was normal.\\nInitial lab values demonstrated normal free triiodothyronine (T3) of 2.4 pg/mL (normal range (NR) 1.8–4.2 pg/mL), normal T3 of 86 ng/dL (NR 70–172 ng/dL), and normal free thyroxine of 1.00 ng/dL (NR 0.84–1.68 ng/dL). Prolactin was elevated at 28.9 ng/mL (NR 2.5–17.0 ng/mL). The patient's morning cortisol was immeasurably low at <1.0 mcg/dL (NR > 10 mcg/dL) as was the patient's testosterone level at <20 ng/dL (280–1100 ng/dL). Luteinizing hormone was low at 0.05 mIU/mL (NR 1.8–12.0 mIU/L).\\nThe patient was started on prednisone 20 mg by mouth daily, at which point he noticed immediate improvement in his energy and appetite as well as decrease in his nausea. For chronic steroid replacement therapy, the patient's treatment was changed from prednisone to hydrocortisone 20 mg of hydrocortisone in the morning and 10 mg in the evening. The patient was additionally instructed about the dangers of adrenal crisis and told to increase his hydrocortisone to 90 mg daily if acutely ill.\\nWithin a month of initial diagnoses, the patient suffered acute visual bilateral field cut and loss of peripheral vision. A repeat MRI demonstrated rapid enlargement of his pituitary mass, nearly doubled in size and described as a 2.2 cm by 1.2 cm mass impinging on the overlying optic chiasm ().\\nThe patient subsequently underwent transsphenoidal resection of his pituitary mass. Gross histology characterized the mass as firm and fibrous. Macroscopic analysis revealed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma described as adenohypophysis fibrosis. Further histologic analysis revealed positive identification of cytokeratin 7, TTF-1, Ki-67, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive with EGFR gene nucleotide change demonstrating T790M and L858R positivity. This histopathology demonstrated further EGFR mutation of the patient's known history of lung adenocarcinoma which initially was only positive for EGFR mutation L585R.\\nAfter transsphenoidal resection and subsequent whole-brain radiation, further results demonstrated a continued low morning cortisol at <1.0 mcg/dL (NR > 10 mcg/dL) and testosterone level at <20 ng/dL (280–1100 ng/dL).

{"uid": "6001149-1", "title": "Thoracic and cutaneous sarcoid-like reaction associated with anti-PD-1 therapy: longitudinal monitoring of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression after stopping treatment", "history": "Nivolumab was initiated to treat a 56-year-old woman, with unresectable NSCLC who initially received an adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed. New lesions appeared and were classified pT3N0M0. Nivolumab therapy was then initiated. Figure summarizes the key clinical and immunological data of the index case as well as the timeline of immune checkpoint analysis.\\nNo sign of SLR was detectable before the treatment with nivolumab (Fig. and ). A partial response was observed after 5 infusions of nivolumab as suggested by CT scan (Fig. and ). Skin lesions appeared after 5 nivolumab infusions (Fig. ), then mediastinal nodes size started to increase and a micronodular interstitial syndrome was observed (Fig. and ) after 20 nivolumab infusions. Biopsies showed epithelioid cells and Langhans multinucleated giant cells without necrosis, microorganisms or refringent bodies, compatible with sarcoid-like inflammation (Fig. ). Tumor cells, alcohol-acid resistant bacilli and fungus or parasite were not detected (data not shown). Nivolumab was then discontinued. According to RECIST criteria, the patient had a partial response at this time.\\nMediastinoscopy revealed sarcoid lesions. Mediastinal nodes sizes (Fig. ) and skin lesions were decreased 155 days later (data not shown), while the interstitial syndrome had deteriorated (Fig. ). Bronchoalveolar lavage showed hypercellularity comprising 41% of lymphocytes without pathogens or cancer cells (data not shown). 348 days later, CT scan showed normal mediastinal nodes and regression of the interstitial syndrome (Fig. ).\\nThe expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 was analyzed on PBMC at various time-points after stopping nivolumab (defined as day 0). An important increase of PD-L1 expression was observed on B and T cells at d56 with a peak at d147, compared to other patients treated with nivolumab without relevant immune related reactions (Fig. ). An elevated expression of PD-L1 was observed on monocytes at d147 (Fig. ). PD-L1 expression by PBMC of the index case returned to basal levels at d251 (Fig. ). If we hypothesize that the increase of PD-L1 expression was consecutive to a rebound effect after stopping the treatment, we would have observed a similar increase in patients treated with nivolumab that did not exhibit immune related events. Moreover, expression of PD-1 on T cells was punctually undetectable at d147 at a time when PD-L1 expression was maximal (Fig. ). No marked change of PD-L2 expression was observed. Intriguingly, the increased PD-L1 expression was evidenced only from day 56 to day 147 after nivolumab arrest (Fig. ). This observation suggests that an elevated expression of PD-L1 consecutive to blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can be associated with sarcoid-like reaction (SLR).", "exam": "Age: [[56.0, 'year']]\nGender: F\nPMID: 29898781", "findings": "Related articles: {'32868911': 1, '27486590': 1, '25609381': 1, '26028407': 1, '31360555': 1, '27157227': 1, '28494868': 1, '27755127': 1, '33922013': 1, '31816084': 1, '27504482': 1, '25073001': 1, '34413300': 1, '32226347': 1, '31662545': 1, '28443311': 1, '27291635': 1, '28031822': 2, '27091806': 1, '29898781': 2}\nSimilar patients: {'5168862-1': 1}", "diagnosis": "", "discussion": "", "images": [], "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": [], "has_history": true, "has_findings": false, "has_diagnosis": false, "has_images": false, "is_complete": false, "dataset_source": "PMC-Patients", "nsclc_source": "PMC-Patients"}

He also complained of intermittent cough with yellowish sputum and dyspnoea upon exertion for half a year. He had a history of well-controlled hypertension and smoking one pack of cigarettes per day. Family history was remarkable for adenocarcinoma of the lung. Travel history was remarkable for travel to Yunnan, China, in the past year.\\nHe first visited a pulmonologist in a local clinic a month prior to admission, where chest X-ray demonstrated increased infiltration over bilateral lung fields. Oral azithromycin was administered, but his dyspnoea progressed. He then visited our clinic for a second opinion. Upon examination, he denied fever, joint pain, dry eyes or mouth, muscle weakness, pitting oedema over lower legs, and skin rash. Physical examination was unremarkable, except chest auscultation demonstrating fine crackles over bilateral lung fields. Chest X-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltration bilaterally (Fig. ). He was admitted for further workup and monitoring of his respiratory performance.\\nDuring hospitalization, the patient had no fever, and respiratory pattern was smooth. Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95% under ambient air. Serum white blood cell count showed no leucocytosis or left shift. Autoimmune markers, including rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-Smith antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, and anti-Scl-70, were all negative. Polymerase chain reaction of Pneumocystis jiroveci from induced sputum was negative. One of three sets of sputum culture demonstrated non-tuberculous mycobacteria, which was later attributed to environmental contamination given his symptoms and image findings. Chest CT disclosed extensive patchy ground-glass opacities superimposed with thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines over both lung fields, demonstrating a “crazy paving” pattern (Fig.).

Gastric biopsies showed poorly differentiated carcinoma (positive TTF1 and cytokeratin AE1-3, negative CDX-2) (Figure ), suggestive of metachronous metastasis from a lung primary. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed and showed a 26 mm × 23 mm hypoechoic round mass in the tail of the pancreas with local vascular involvement and splenic vein thrombus (Figure ). EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) and fine needle biopsy (FNB) of the mass was performed through the gastric lumen (away from the gastric tumor to avoid tumor contamination or seeding by the needle tract). This confirmed neuroendocrine carcinoma (positive synaptophysin and chromogranin, positive Ki-67 and CDX-2, negative TTF1) (Figure ). Findings were suggestive of synchronous primary pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Treatment options were discussed with the patient and his family. Patient opted for palliative care and received symptomatic treatment.\\nMetastasis of primary lung tumor to the stomach is infrequent and sporadic. The pathogenesis is thought to be related to the tumor cell spread via the hematogenous and lymphatic routes, but there is no specific data demonstrating a particular tropism for a segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Only 21 sporadic cases have been reported in the English literature and involved different malignant cell types: squamous cell carcinoma (10 cases), adenocarcinoma (6 cases), small cell carcinoma (2 cases), pleomorphic (2 cases), and large cell carcinoma (1 case). Symptomatic cases presented with epigastric pain, chronic anemia, signs of GI bleed (hematemesis, melena), and gastric perforations (in two cases). The definite role of PET-CT in the diagnosis of GI metastasis from lung cancer is still controversial because of the few cases and lack of enough clinical data. EUS-FNA in combination with immunohistochemistry is useful for diagnosing metastatic lesions and differentiating those from synchronous primary lesions.,", "exam": "Age: [[59.0, 'year']]\nGender: M\nPMID: 29988660", "findings": "Related articles: {'29085618': 2, '31057297': 1, '22634567': 1, '26671541': 1, '17010474': 1, '29988660': 2}\nSimilar patients: {'5658634-1': 1}", "diagnosis": "", "discussion": "", "images": [], "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": [], "has_history": true, "has_findings": false, "has_diagnosis": false, "has_images": false, "is_complete": false, "dataset_source": "PMC-Patients", "nsclc_source": "PMC-Patients"}

Computed tomography (CT) had been performed for a medical checkup, and a small nodule was detected in the left upper lobe (S1+2) a year before she visited our hospital. Follow-up CT showed that the nodule with indentation was growing to 22 mm in size, and she was referred to a nearby hospital (Fig. ). Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), brain magnetic resonance imaging, and transbronchial biopsy were performed, showing left upper lung adenocarcinoma classified as cT1bN0M0 Stage IA according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification (seventh edition). Though contrast-enhanced three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (3DCT) of the pulmonary vessels was usually performed to identify the pulmonary branches preoperatively at that time, it was not performed in the present case due to renal dysfunction, and abnormal branching of the left pulmonary artery was not identified. Video-assisted thoracoscopic left upper lobectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed. A1+2c, the upper pulmonary vein, mediastinal A4+5, A3, and A1+2a+b were detached carefully and dissected. Before separation of the interlobar fissure was completed, a pulmonary mediastinal branch from the left main pulmonary artery was identified descending between the upper pulmonary vein and upper bronchus. The interlobar fissure was separated safely with preservation of A8 (Figs. and ).

{"uid": "6031552-1", "title": "Pure high-grade fetal adenocarcinoma of the lung: a case report", "history": "A 63-year-old Japanese man, a current smoker of more than 45 pack-years, was revealed by routine examination’s chest X-ray to have an abnormal shadow in the left middle lung field. His past medical history was unremarkable. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3.6 × 2.8 cm pulmonary lesion in the left upper lobe, with a clear boundary and heterogeneous contrast enhancement (Fig. ). Positron emission tomography (PET) showed an accumulation of 18F-fluorodexyglucose (FDG) with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 4.95 in the early phase and 6.31 in the late phase in the nodule. No accumulation of FDG was noted in the pulmonary hilum, or mediastinal lymph nodes.\\nA trans-bronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) of the mass in the left upper lobe was performed; it revealed non-small cell carcinoma. Although the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 52.1 ng/mL (normal range 0–5.0 ng/mL), there were no distant metastases or other cancer lesions. The preoperative clinical diagnosis of primary lung cancer, stage cT2aN0M0 stage IB was considered.\\nA left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection were performed by video-assisted thoracic surgery. The resected tumor measured 3.8 × 2.8 × 2.8 cm in diameter.\\nGrossly, the specimen showed a well-established boundary as a grayish lesion with areas of necrosis. The histopathological examination showed a solid proliferation of columnar atypical cells with cell cytoplasm and complex glandular structures with abundant desmoplastic stroma, a morphological resemblance to fetal lung and significant tumor necrosis (Fig. , ). Conventional lung adenocarcinoma, another histological component and morulae were not found. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining demonstrated glycogen in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells. Stains for mucin were negative. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for AE1/AE3, CEA, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (focal) (Fig. ). Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), chromogranin A, synaptophysin, CD56, and p40 were negative. The beta-catenin result was positive, predominantly in the cell membrane (Fig. ). The final histopathological diagnosis was H-FLAC.\\nBoth lymphatic and vascular invasion were detected. Microscopically, all margins were free and mediastinal lymph nodes (#5) showed metastasis. The final pathological staging was stage IIIA (pT2aN2M0). Both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements were negative. The expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) (Dako, clone 22C3) by resected specimen was negative.\\nThe patient received cisplatin plus vinorelbine as adjuvant chemotherapy, but it was canceled at two courses because of the dehydration and hyperglycemia induced by the chemotherapy. At 25 months after the surgery, the patient had relapsed pleural dissemination. Postoperative serum CEA and AFP was 1.5 and 3.7 ng/mL, respectively. But, serum CEA at the time of relapse was 132.4 ng/mL, and AFP was unfortunately not searched.", "exam": "Age: [[63.0, 'year']]\nGender: M\nPMID: 29974291", "findings": "Related articles: {'12754743': 1, '33889510': 1, '25851923': 1, '28840008': 1, '9537466': 1, '32227456': 2, '23629442': 1, '6179430': 1, '21252716': 1, '29974291': 2}\nSimilar patients: {'7262892-1': 1}", "diagnosis": "", "discussion": "", "images": [], "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": [], "has_history": true, "has_findings": false, "has_diagnosis": false, "has_images": false, "is_complete": false, "dataset_source": "PMC-Patients", "nsclc_source": "PMC-Patients"}
