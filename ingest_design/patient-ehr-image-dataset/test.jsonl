It corresponds to WHO grade III glioma.  It accounts for 30-60 of all choroid plexus tumors in children.  50% occur in the lateral ventricles.  The most common presentation is obstructive hydrocephalus (vomiting, vision changes, headache, balance problems, mental status changes).  \nOn CT, these lesions are seen arising from the choroid plexus and are often hyperdense on non-contrast images.  They have a grape-like or cauliflower appearance and avidly enhance.  They often cause ventricular obstruction.  Central necrosis and hemorrhage may occur.  The differential diagnosis includes choriod plexus pappiloma, medulloepithelioma (infants), teratoma, and metastasic adenocarcinoma (adults).   The 5-year survival is 40%.\nReferences\n1.  \"http://wiki.cns.org/wiki/index.php/Choroid_Plexus_Carcinoma\"  Site accessed on 02/07/08.

May be a congenital. Carcinomas usually seen only in pediatric age group.\n\nClinical Presentation: Hydrocephalus with headaches\n\nHistology: Papillomas have characteristic lobulated gross appearance. Most are well-differentiated and may resemble normal choroid plexus, however, anaplastic transformation may occur. Parenchymal invasion suggests carcinoma, but can be seen with benign tumors as well.\n\nTransformation of papilloma into carcinoma has been reported.\n\nSpecial Stains: Cytokeratin distinguishes CPP from ependymoma; Prealbumin (transthyretin) may be helpful (although choroid metastases may also stain positive)\nProgression: CSF seeding may occur in both papillomas and carcinomas.\n\nRadiology: Well-demarcated intraventricular (or cerebellopontine angle) mass with hydrocephalus. Calcification especially frequent in fourth ventricular tumors. In adult patients the fourth ventricle is more common. The tumor is attached to the choroid plexus.\n\nComments: Hydrocephalus may reflect multiple factors, including CSF over-production, ventricular obstruction, and impaired CSF reabsorption. Can present as a congenital brain tumor or neoplasm.\n\n===================================================\n[REF 1]\n\"Choroid plexus tumours are rare epithelial brain tumours and limited information is available regarding their biology and the best treatment. A meta-analysis was done to determine prognostic factors and the influence of various treatment modalities. A thorough review of the medical literature (1966-1998) revealed 566 well-documented choroid plexus tumours. These were entered into a  database, which was analysed to determine prognostic factors and treatment modalities. Most patients with a supratentorial tumour\n were children, while the most common sites in adults were the fourth ventricle and the cerebellar pontine angle. Cerebellar pontine angle tumours were more frequently benign. Histology was the most important prognostic factor, as one, five, and 10-year projected survival rates were 90, 81, and 77% in choroid plexus-papilloma (n=353) compared to only 71, 41, and 35% in choroid plexus-carcinoma respectively (P<0.0005). Surgery was prognostically relevant for both choroid plexus-papilloma (P=0.0005) and choroid plexus-carcinoma (P=0.0001). Radiotherapy was associated with significantly better survival in choroid plexus-carcinomas.\n\nEight of 22 documented choroid plexus-carcinomas responded to chemotherapy. Relapse after primary treatment was a poor prognostic factor in choroid plexus-carcinoma patients but not in choroid plexus-papilloma patients. Treatment of choroid plexus tumours should start with radical surgical resection. This should be followed by adjuvant treatment in case of choroid plexus-carcinoma, and a \"wait and see\" approach in choroid plexus-papilloma.

Although this patient had no known history of hypertension, her CT and MRI both demonstrate evidence of chronic small vessel ischemia secondary to longstanding hypertension.  The differential diagnosis for a hemorrhagic lesion in the putamen/posterior capsule includes lacunar infarct, hypertensive hemorrhage, vascular malformation, and neoplasm.\n\nLacunar infarcts represent 15-20% of all strokes, and appear as small cavitary lesions in subcortical regions.  They result from the thrombosis of a small penetrating artery, often as a result of a chronic hypertensive change known as lipohyalinosis.  Characteristic locations for lacunar infarcts include the following:  putamen (37%), pons (16%), thalamus (14%), caudate (10%), and internal capsule (10%).  Posterior limb lacunes are the most important clinically because of their potential for severe motor and sensory deficits.  Anterior limb lacunes are often clincally silent.\nThese \"perforating\" arteries (lenticulostriate aa., thalamogeniculate aa., and anterior choroidal branch of ICA) are common sites for both lacunar infarcts and hypertensive hemorrhage, and both types of lesions can result from a process known as lipohyalinosis.  This is the impregnation of hyaline-lipid material into the walls of small arteries in the setting of hypertension combined with atherosclerosis.  Lipohyalinosis predisposes the artery to thrombosis and may also weaken the vessel wall, resulting in small dissecting \"Charcot-Bouchard\" aneurysms.\n\nHypertensive hemorrhages are slightly less common than lacunar infarcts, representing 10-15% of all strokes.  Two-thirds of hypertensive hemorrhages occur in the putamen, but most cases occur in the presence of systolic blood pressures much higher than 170.

The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related” aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

The incidence of hydrocephalus is equal in men and women.  However, there are a few exceptions such as an X-linked hydrocephalus and normal pressure hydrocephalus that is predominant in male patients.\n\nThis 21 yr old woman presented with headache and was diagnosed with aqueductal stenosis.  Headache is the most common clinical manifestation of an adult with aqueductal stenosis.  The signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with age and disease progression.  A symptomatic adult patient could have additional neurological symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, blurred and double vision, gait impairment, drowsiness and cognitive deterioration.  Possible physical exam findings include those due to increased intracranial pressure such as papilledema, failure of upward gaze and accommodation, enlarged head, and gait instability(1).  \n\nBased on the imaging findings, the patient suffered from chronic hydrocephalus because there was no significant transependymal flow of CSF or sulcal effacement .  Chronic hydrocephalus are typically due to congenital causes or longstanding processes, and this patient’s aqueductal septations are likely associated with post-inflammatory changes and sequelae of her childhood case of salmonella meningitis.  The incidence of chronic hydrocephalus increases with increasing age and clinical symptoms appear when hydrocephalus decompensates due to late onset of aqueductal stenosis (3,4).  \n\nIn order to relieve the pressure and improve patient’s clinical manifestation, this patient underwent VP shunt placement.  Currently, there are two forms of surgical treatment for aqueductal stenosis: shunt placement and endoscopic third ventriculostomy.  Shunt surgery remains the standard of care due to its effectiveness, but ETV experience is growing with improving patency rates and avoids shunt malfunction complications.  After obstruction is resolved, a patient’s gait, postural function, cognitive functions may improve (1).  This patient had complete resolution of headache.\n\nReferences:\n1.\tTisell, M, Tullberg, M, Hellstrom, P, Blomsterwall, E, Wikkelso, C. Neurological symptoms and signs in adult aqueductal stenosis.

Histologically the tumor is composed of spindle shaped cells interspersed within a collagen matrix. Grossly the lesions appear as pleural based masses. Occasionally they may be surrounded entirely by lung. Seventy five percent arise from the visceral pleura while the remaining twenty five percent arise from the parietal pleura. The mass is pedunclated in fifty percent of the tumors; this form has the greatest association with benignity. Histologically malignant tumors often invade the chest wall and mediastinum.\n\nClinically the patients are usually asymptomatic and the tumors are found as an incidental finding. The tumors are slow growing and, when symptomatic, the patient presents with cough, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is seen in 4%-12% of the cases and is more common in larger tumors (> 7cm).

The classic triad presentation of RCC includes flank pain, hematuria and a palpable abdominal mass.  These three findings are only seen in approximately ten percent of cases, and currently most cases are detected incidentally on imaging studies.  Gross or microscopic hematuria is the most reliable symptom, but may be intermittent indicating the neoplasm may remain silent until it attains a particular size.  Therefore, imaging studies of the genitourinary tract should be performed on any patient older than forty years of age with hematuria.\n\nTraditionally, RCC has been classified based on histology.  In the past two decades, molecular genetic investigations of RCC have led to recurring chromosomal abnormalities occurring with specific RCC histological subtypes.  Therefore, in 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) integrated these consistent genetic abnormalities into the previous classification of renal neoplasms.  Moreover, observations have indicated associated inherited cancer syndromes, which were reflected in the new WHO classification system.  Of these subtypes, the most relevant subtypes include:  Clear Cell (conventional), Papillary and Chromophobe, accounting for approximately seventy percent, fifteen to twenty percent, and five to ten percent of renal neoplasms, respectively.(1)  The remaining subtypes are extremely less common.\n\nClear cell renal carcinoma (Figure 4), usually occurs as a solitary unilateral lesion from the proximal tubular epithelium.  The growth pattern can be varied, but ranges from solid, trabecular or tubular.  Histologically, the cells can have a rounded or polygonal shape, with clear or granular cytoplasm.  The neoplastic cells have intracytoplasmic glycogen and lipids, which are dissolved during the preparation of the biopsy, giving the cells their clear appearance seen microscopically.  The lipid containing cells in this subtype give the neoplasm its classic golden/yellow color on gross observation.(2)\n\nPapillary carcinoma (Figure 3) is characterized by a papillary growth pattern, with the papillary projections having a fibrovascular core consisting of foamy macrophages.  There are two subtypes of papillary carcinoma recognized and  differentiated by histomorphological characteristics.  Type I neoplasms have a monolayer of cells with little cytoplasm.  Type II neoplasms have an abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and typically distinct nucleoli.(3)\n\nChromophobe renal carcinoma (Figure 5) is usually situated around blood vessels arranged in sheets.  This neoplasm is composed of pale eosinophilic cells, often with a perinuclear halo.  Abrahams et al found accentuated cell borders and a combination of hyperchromatic wrinkled nuclei, and perinuclear halos were the three most often associated histological features associated with this subtype.(4)\tCollecting duct renal carcinoma (CDC), or Bellini duct carcinoma, is an extremely rare entity, accounting for less than one percent of renal neoplasms.  The neoplasm is located centrally with a gray appearance.  Its borders are irregular and infiltrative with a so-called hobnail pattern. This subtype has been shown to have various histological patterns within a single neoplasm ranging from duct-like to papillary architecture, and therefore has been known to be misdiagnosed.  This disease usually is diagnosed in advanced stage, and with its high rate of metastasis has a dismal prognosis.(5)\n\nRenal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an extremely rare entity and associated with the sickle cell trait.  Histologically, the neoplasm resembles CDC and grossly resembles urothelial carcinoma by its location, pattern and grade.  RMC can be arranged in solid sheets, but usually in a reticular pattern with yolk sac-like areas.

The left thyroid lobe was resected due to suppurative thyroiditis and left thyroid lobe abscess.", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Fourth Branchial Cleft Cyst", "acr_code": "2.1", "category": "Congenital, malformation", "disease_discussion": "The branchial apparatus serves as an embryological precursor to the tissues of the neck.  It consists of four branchial arches, clefts and pouches.  The branchial arches form musculoskeletal and vascular structures of the head and neck while the pouches form the middle ear, tonsils, thymus and parathyroid gland.  The first branchial clefts give rise to the external ear but the other three branchial clefts involute during normal development.  Failure of the other branchial clefts to involute forms a branchial cleft cyst.  Rarely, when a residual branchial cleft connects with a pouch structure, a complete sinus tract from the pharynx to a blind pouch cyst will form.\n\nBranchial cleft anomalies differ in clinical presentation depending on the specific cleft that fails to involute.  Classically, branchial cleft cysts present as a well demarcated mass along the anterior upper third along the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  This presentation is consistent with a second branchial cleft cyst which accounts for 95% of branchial cleft anomalies.  Fourth branchial cleft anomalies are the rarest developmental defect of the branchial apparatus.  These defects commonly form a fistula extending from the apex of the pyriform sinus to end as a blind pouch near the superior pole of the thyroid gland.  \n\nFourth branchial anomalies are often not appreciated on physical exam until they become secondarily infected.  Typical presentation is that of an inflammatory neck mass, often involving the thyroid gland.  These lesions most commonly occur on the left side of the neck.  Common sources of secondary infection include oropharyngeal pathogens that inoculate the sinus tract, usually after an upper respiratory infection or surgical manipulation of the oral cavity.  Infections can present as generalized erythema and cellulitis along the sinus tract or as supprative thyroditis.  Recurrent supprative thyroiditis is highly suggestive of a fourth branchial cleft sinus.\n\nThe initial imaging test of choice is a contrast enhanced CT scan of the neck to detect the location and extent of the lesion.  Finding air within a left-sided neck infection in close relation to the thyroid gland is thought to be almost pathognomonic for a fourth branchial cleft sinus tract.  A barium study of the pharynx is often utilized to further localize the path of the sinus tract.  Ultimately, definitive diagnosis occurs by direct pharyngoscopy to identify the origin of the sinus tract within the pyriform sinus.\n\nInitial management consists of antibiotic therapy.  The antibiotic regimen will vary depending on culture results if a biopsy is performed or the clinician’s judgment if not performed.  Definitive treatment is surgical excision.  Incision and drainage is a poor therapeutic option given the high rate of recurrence without obliteration of the sinus tract.  An isolated cyst that has become secondarily infection can be excised once antibiotics have controlled local inflammation.  With fourth branchial cleft sinus tracts, optimal therapy consists of closure of the sinus opening.  Surgical options for closure include endoscopic assisted monopolar diathermy, abrasion with Tisseel surgical sealant closure of the sinus or another variation of the same theme.

See factoid.", "topic_title": "Midgut malrotation", "acr_code": "7.1", "category": "Congenital, malformation", "disease_discussion": "Embryology:  The alimentary tract initially develops as a pouchlike extension of the yolk sac. At 6 weeks gestation, the intestinal tract is a continuous, tubular structure that is divided into the foregut (supplied by the celiac artery), midgut (supplied by the superior mesenteric artery), and hindgut (supplied mainly by the inferior mesenteric artery). During embryonic development, the bowel introduces itself into the abdomen and both the duodenojejunal and ileocolic segments of the primitive digestive tube rotate 270° counterclockwise about the omphalomesenteric vessels (ie, the future superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein) to reach their final normal positions.  Before 6 weeks gestation, the duodenum initially rotates 90° counterclockwise so that it lies to the right of the superior mesenteric artery. Similarly, the cecum rotates 90° counterclockwise so that it lies to the left of the superior mesenteric artery. During the 6th week of gestation, the duodenum rotates another 90° counterclockwise so that it lies posterior to the superior mesenteric artery. By the 10th to 12th weeks of gestation, the intestine slides back into the peritoneal cavity, where the final 90° rotation of the duodenum and 180° rotation of the cecum occur. The right colon is the last portion of the gastrointestinal tract to rotate completely, allowing the cecum to descend into the right lower quadrant. This rotation is followed in the last stage by peritoneal fixation of the bowel. The small bowel mesentery is normally broad based, with its attachment extending from the ligament of Trietz to the ileocecal valve. This wide base prevents the small intestine from twisting around the superior mesenteric artery. Malrotation most commonly is caused by incomplete rotation (<270° of counterclockwise rotation occurring in weeks 5-12).\n\nThis group of disorders can be divided into 3 different categories:1) Nonrotation (0° to <90° of counterclockwise rotation occurring before 6 weeks), 2) Reverse rotation (abnormal rotation >90° and <180° causing obstruction or reversal of the normal duodenal/SMA relationship, occurring in weeks 6-10), and 3) Malrotation most often associated with malfixation (>180° and <270° of counterclockwise rotation, occurring after 10 weeks). Nonrotation is often an incidental finding in older children and adults during routine examination, but volvulus as a result of local clockwise rotation may accompany this anomaly.\n\nClinical: Incidence is unknown, as many are asymptomatic. No racial or gender predilection is seen. In approximately 60% of patients, malrotation presents by age 1 month with bilious vomiting and high intestinal obstruction. Another 20-30% of patients present at age 1-12 months. Older children with malrotation may show failure to thrive, chronic recurrent abdominal pain, malabsorption, or other vague presentations. The older the child, the less readily identifiable the clinical presentation. Nonrotation of the intestine may be asymptomatic, thus is an incidental finding on UGI performed for other reasons. \n\nRadiographic findings: \nPlain films: In midgut volvulus, the classic radiographic finding is a partial duodenal obstruction (dilation of both the stomach and proximal duodenum, with paucity of bowel gas distally). \nUGI: The preferred diagnostic test for malrotation with midgut volvulus. Duodenal-jejunal junction (DJJ) displaced downward and to the right on the frontal view An abnormal position of the jejunum (lying on right side of abdomen) should alert one to the possibility of a malrotation but should not be relied upon to either make or exclude the diagnosis. Corkscrew of small bowel around SMA.\nUS: The \"whirlpool sign\" on color Doppler shows mesentery and flow within the SMV wrapping around the SMA (in a clockwise direction), indicating malrotation with volvulus \nCT: The DJJ is low and to the right of the normal location. The duodenum doesn’t cross midline. The proximal jejunum is in the right upper quadrant. The cecum is in the upper and/or left abdomen. The large bowel is in the left abdomen. Abnormal relationship of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The SMV should lie to the right of the SMA. \n\nTreatment: Silent malrotation requires no treatment.

If the superior segment remains aerated, the upper half of the major fissure is commonly seen as a horizontal line contacting the spine on frontal radiographs.

Pain is usually the initial presenting complaint and often starts in the peri-umbilical region before migrating to the right lower quadrant with maximal tenders often located at McBurney’s point.  This typical sequence is absent in more than 1/3 of older children.  Often pain is worse with movement, coughing (cough sign) driving over bump (cat\\'s eye sign), or standing on toes and dropping heels to ground (heel drop sign) (Rothrock).  Vomiting occurs in the majority of school-aged children and may precede or begin concurrent with pain.  Physical exam often reveals an elevated temperature and tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant.  However, tenderness may involve the entire lower abdomen, or may be diffuse, especially with a perforation.  Compared with those with non-perforated appendicitis, children with perforated appendicitis are significantly younger, have a longer duration of symptoms before diagnosis, have more physician visits before correct diagnosis, have higher temperatures, and are more likely to exhibit vomiting, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and peritoneal signs (Rothrock).  Perforation generally occurs 36 to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.     Plain abdominal radiographs have been recommended as potentially useful for evaluating children with suspected appendicitis.  Radiographic findings believed to be suggestive of appendicitis include rightward scoliosis, soft tissue masses, localized ileus, bowel obstruction, calcified fecolith, and free peritoneal fluid.  Of these features, the most specific for appendicitis is a calcified fecolith (appendicolith) found in up to 13% to 22% with appendicitis and in only 1% to 2% of those without (Rothrock).  While often recommended, these films rarely altered a patient\\'s diagnosis or management.       Ultrasonography is appropriate in patients in which the diagnosis is unclear by history and physical examination, especially in pediatric and female patients.  A normal appendix must be identified to rule out appendicitis.  An inflamed appendix usually measures greater than 6 mm in diameter, is non-compressible and tender with focal compression (Hardin).  Numerous other right lower quadrant conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cecal diverticulitis, Meckel\\'s diverticulum, endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease can cause false-positive ultrasonography results (Hardin).       Appendiceal CT is more accurate than ultrasound and consists of a focused, helical CT after a Gastrografin-saline enema.  It can be performed and interpreted usually within an hour.  The accuracy of CT is due in part to its ability to identify a normal appendix better than ultrasound.  If appendiceal CT is not available, standard abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast remains useful and may still be more accurate than ultrasound (Hardin).     The standard for management of appendicitis remains appendectomy.  The procedure may be performed by laparotomy (usually through a small right lower quadrant incision) or laparoscopy.  While laparoscopic intervention is advantageous in adults due to decreased postoperative pain, earlier return to normal activity and better cosmetic results, an open appendectomy remains the primary approach to treatment in children due to their smaller size (Rothrock).\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15155894", "keywords": "appendicitis", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2028_synpic34049", "MPX2028_synpic34050", "MPX2028_synpic34052", "MPX2028_synpic34053", "MPX2028_synpic34054", "MPX2028_synpic34055"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2028_synpic34049", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2028_synpic34049.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Axial CT images from the mid abdomen following oral and intravenous contrast material administration demonstrate a blind-ending loop of bowel arising from the cecum directed superiorly with the tip just inferior to the inferior margin of the liver.

The head is maintained in neutral position in the midline. Before transportation, the patient's body is securely strapped at all major joints, the head is taped to the board, and sandbags may be applied alongside the head. On arrival in the emergency department, the protective cocoon must be partially removed to allow assessment of the patient, but it is critical that the immobilization of the spine be maintained until an unstable injury has been ruled out both by radiologic and clinical examination. In the cervical spine, it is essential for the radiographs to include all seven cervical vertebrae, down to and including the articulation between C7 and T1. The lower portion of the cervical spine is often difficult to visualize well on lateral views, especially in large patients.

Displaced fractures of the cervical spine are usually treated with careful application of traction, using a halo or Gardner-Wells tongs. Weight is gradually added to the traction apparatus until the spine is realigned. The rule of thumb is that a weight of approximately 5 pounds per cervical level is required for reduction. The neurologic examination must be followed very closely as weight is added to the traction. Serial radiographs are used to determine when adequate reduction has been obtained. Inability to obtain adequate reduction is usually an indication for surgical intervention.Those injuries thought to be relatively stable or with instability in only one column can be managed with immobilization only. For significant fractures this involves the use of a halo brace in the cervical spine, and an orthosis, usually a molded jacket, in the thoracic and lumbar spine. Unstable injuries usually require surgical stabilization. Stabilization can be achieved by placement of hardware posteriorly, by use of hardware and bone grafting anteriorly, or in some cases using both techniques simultaneously. The anterior approach allows better access to the vertebral body and better decompression of the spinal canal. Three-column injuries generally require both anterior and posterior stabilization.The benefits of early spinal stabilization in patients with complete injury are primarily related to the prevention of complications of long-term immobilization. Data show fewer complications in patients whose spinal injuries are fixed early, although there are no compelling survival differences. Therefore, spinal column injuries should be fixed as early as practical, once the patient is physiologically stable and no longer at risk to suffer deterioration of neurologic function, either from exacerbation of brain injury or as a result of manipulation of the spinal cord.", "keywords": "fracturespine", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2555_synpic14611"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2555_synpic14611", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2555_synpic14611.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "C-spine CT- multiple fractures on C1, bilateral posterior ring, right anterior ring.

Some disease processes known to cause these problems include cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, COPD, bronchiectasis, bronchitis, asthma, Kartagener’s syndrome, tuberculosis, aspergillous ect.  \n     \nThe exact mechanism of mucus plugging is not known.  Mucus accumulation is governed by the rate of mucus secretion and clearance through epithelial reabsorption, evaporation, cough transport, and ciliary transport. A defect in any one of these systems can disrupt the balance and cause pathology.  It is postulated in infammatory processes that the inflammation and edema impair the mucociliary transport system, and epithelial reabsorption causing an inability to effectively clear the mucus that is produced.  Accummulation of mucus in lungs with mucosal edema and bronchoconstriction give optimal conditions for airway plugging.    \n     \nOther causes of increased mucosal production are decreased cilia motility include inhaled pollutants.  The most notorious of these is cigarette smoke which is also one of the major risk factors for developing COPD.  Under optimal conditions, mucus can be propelled by cilia at speeds up to 10mm/min with cilia beating at 20Hz.  Normal functioning cilia can clear 50% of particulate matter introduced into the lung in approximately 30 minutes.  However, this lung function can be dramatically reduced in acute and chronic lung processes leading to pulmonary dysfunction.\n     \nThere are a variety of methods to control the accumulation of mucus in the pulmonary system.  Proposed methods include inhibiting hypersecretion, stimulating ciliary clearance, and stimulating cough clearance. It was believed that mucolytic agents such as N-acetylcysteine help decrease the viscosity and elasticity of the mucus allowing for easier clearance. However, studies involving this medication have not shown a significant effect in the clearance of mucus.  Chest physical therapy which moves mucus by gravity, vibration has been demonstrated to increase mucus clearance and is a commonly emplyed therapy. Bronchodilators are also often used to help open the airways.

The clinical presentation of tuberous sclerosis is dependent on the age of the patient, the organ systems involved, and the severity of their involvement.  Classically, however, tuberous sclerosis presents with Vogt’s triad:  adenoma sebaceum (Pringle’s disease), mental retardation, and seizures.  Adenoma sebaceum are angiofibromas that usually develop between the ages of 1 and 4 years.  They are usually pink or red papules that form on the face in a malar distribution, similar to the butterfly rash of SLE.  They occur in approximately 75% of tuberous sclerosis patients.    \n\nAnother common physical exam finding in tuberous sclerosis is hypopigmented macules on the trunk and extremities.

In 1882, Franz Ludwig Neubebauer described spondylolisthesis in women who had died during labor due to difficulties resulting from narrow birth canals. The word is of Greek origin, spondylo meaning spine and listhesis meaning slippage or slip. \nSpondylolisthesis is defined as a displacement of a superior vertebra in relation to the inferior one. The most common type of spondylolisthesis occurs due to fracture of the pars interarticularis, with L5/S1 being the most frequent level. A grading system that is commonly used describes a grade 1 as displacement of 25% or less of the involved vertebra, grade 2 is displacement greater than 25% and up to 50%, grade 3 is displacement greater than 50% and up to 75% and grade 4 is greater than 75% displacement and up to 100% displacement. \nBecause spondylolisthesis typically occurs at levels below the spinal cord, the condition is rarely fatal. However, besides low back pain, nerve root involvement is common, especially because of compression from the inferior articular process. Other common presentations besides musculoskeletal pain and radiculopathy are related to degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis when present. \nAs mentioned previously, there are different etiologies of spondylolisthesis. The most common, occurring nearly 80% of the time, is type II, or spondylolytic spondylolisthesis (also known as isthmic). This commonly follows spondylolysis, often as a result of athletic activity (common athletics include diving, gymnastics, and wrestling). Type I is congenital, or dysplastic, and is a defect involving the facet joint that allows displacement. Type III is due to degenerative changes and is common in older patients. Type IV is traumatic and can be included in Type 2, but also includes trauma that causes displacement but that does not involve the pars interarticularis. Lastly, type V is pathologic spondylolisthesis, such as displacement following a fracture due to a neoplasm. \nLateral radiographs are often excellent for diagnosing and grading sponylolisthesis, especially when the displacement is anterior/posterior. Oblique views are also helpful to view the pars interarticularis, which is often described as a “Scotty dog” (the eye is the pedicle, the ear is the superior articular process, and a fracture of the par interarticularis is described as the collar and appears as a lucency). CT imaging is often used to confirm the diagnosis as well as to better define bony defects, whether it be a fracture of the pars interarticularis, fractures elsewhere allowing displacement, or other bony anomalies. MR imaging is used to image soft tissue, such as nerve root involvement, spinal stenosis, and disc disorders. \nSpondylolisthesis is common; 5% of adults have a degree of displacement. Spondylolysis involvement is twice as common in men compared to women, and etiologies such as dysplastic and degenerative are more common in women. Eskimos have an incidence as high as 50% in adults for reasons unknown. \nTreatments are typically performed by orthopedic surgeons or neurosurgeons when symptoms and disability are determined severe enough.

The normal size diameter of the aorta in this area is 2 cm.  The pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms is multifactorial.  Familial clustering, genetic predisposition, and hemodynamic factors all play a role in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms.  The overall incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is 15 to 37 cases per 100,000 patient years.  \n\nMuch of the research has focused on the relationship of aneurysm size to the risk of rupture.  Studies using CT and ultrasound have recorded average expansion rates of  0.4 cm per year.  Risk factors for rupture include elevated blood pressure, smoking,  atherosclerotic disease, and the presence of COPD.  Smoking is the major risk factor for aneurysm formation.  Aneurysms can also occur as part of certain disease such as Marfans or Ehler-Danlos syndrome.  The risk of rupture for aneurysms less than 4.0 cm is 2 percent.  For aneurysm greater than 5.0 cm the risk is between 25 to 41 percent.  The risk of rupture for aneurysms between 4 to 5 cm is between 3 to 12 percent.  Immediate repair vs. surveillance for aneurysms less than 5.5 cm has not improved survival. \n\nAbdominal ultrasound can be used as screening tool for abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Ultrasound has sensitivity of 100 percent.  Both the longitudinal and transverse aortic diameters can be measured and there is no need for IV contrast.  Ultrasound can measure aneurysm within a range of 0.6 cm.  Ultrasound is limited in its use for surgical planning because it cannot document the proximal or distal extent of the aneurysm. \n\nCT is highly sensitive and specific for identification of abdominal aortic aneurysms and is more accurate in determining the size of the aneurysm.  CT is also valuable in surgical planning because it provides information on the anatomical relationship of the visceral and renal vessels.  Disadvantages to CT include the need for IV contrast and exposure to radiation.\n\nThe mortality of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is over 90 percent, but for those who make it to a hospital alive 50 percent survive.

The axial component consists of the bronchovascular couplets (bronchiole and accompanying pulmonary artery). The peripheral space is composed of pulmonary veins and paired lymphatics and run within the interlobular septa. The peripheral component is continuous with the pleura. Finally, the interstitial parenchyma consists of the gas exchanging components of the lung (i.e. the walls of the alveoli). An understanding of these components allows one to think logically of the disease categories which affect the lung interstitium. This is especially true is regard to the interpretation of HRCT.\n\nWhile there are numerous methods by which to categorize ILD none are completely satisfying for ILD consists of a broad array of processes that share similar histopathologic and radiographic manifestations. Broadly they may be categorized as follows: (1) interstitial pneumonias (UIP, DIP), (2) diffuse infiltrative processes characterized by granuloma formation [e.g. sarcoidosis], (3) lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, (4) pneumoconioses, (5) ILD associated with cysts [LAM and EG], (6) disorders characterized by interlobular septal thickening (pulmonary edema, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and primary lymphangitic carcinomatosis), (7) eosinophilic syndromes, (8) pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes and (9) vasculitis. The combination of radiographic, clinical and laboratory findings are usually necessary to make a diagnosis and biopsy may be necessary to be definitive. \n\nPULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS ---- PAP was shown to complicate the underlying COPD in the case presented. As noted above, PAP is within the category of diseases associated with interlobular septal thickening. Populations at risk for development of PAP include the immunocompromised (e.g lymphopenia in children and leukemia in adults); humans exposed to high concentrations of silicon dioxide; those infected with a variety of microorganisms (especially Nocardia, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus).\n\nPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN PAP show the alveoli to be filled with fine granular material which stains positive with periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS+). Further histopathologic findings which may be present include: air-spaces filled with cholesterol crystals as well as needle-shaped crystals and laminated bodies (probably cellular fragments) and degenerating macrophages. Rarely interstitial fibrosis is present. \n\nRADIOGRAPHICALLY PAP was first described in a group of 27 patients in 1958. All demonstrated perihilar vaguely nodular air-space consolidation on plain film.  Less severe disease may manifest as ground-glass opacity only. In general, findings may range from ill defined nodular densities or patchy areas of confluence confined to the lower lung to diffuse consolidation throughout both lungs. On conventional CT PAP may manifest as ill defined consolidation, while on HRCT the characteristic “crazy-paving” may be evident.

If the cusps are included in the measurement, this dilation measures approximately 6.8 cm in transverse dimensions x 5.7 cm in AP dimensions.  If the cusps are not included in the measurement, the aortic root measures approximately 5.2 cm transverse x 5.8 cm in maximum  AP dimension. Dilation of the cardiac silhouette is noted compatible with cardiomegaly\n\nDIAGNOSIS: 1. Aneurysmal dilation of the aortic root suspicious for sinus of Valsalva aneurysm as described above. 2.Cardiomegaly\n\nDIFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Ascending Aortic Aneurysm secondary to syphilis, Dilation of the aortic root secondary to conective tissue diseases including Marfan’s Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Trauma, or Dissection.\n\nDISCUSSION: Aneurysms of the thoracic aorta are classified by location with the most common being the descending portion of the aorta. The ascending portion of the aorta is the second most common with aneurysms of the arch of the aorta being the most rare. \nCauses for thoracic aortic aneurysms usually consist of cystic medial necrosis. This may be a result of connective tissue disorders such as Marfan’s syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Other causes can include athersclerotic vascular disease, syphilis, infectious aortitis, trauma, and dissection. \nThere are a wide range of signs and symptoms associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms. Most problems associated with this disease entity are cardio-vascular in nature. This includes congestive heart failure, continuous murmur, and thromboembolism. If the aneurysm is large enough superior vena cava syndrome may occur secondary to mass affect. It has been reported that up to forty percent of patients with aneurysms involving the thoracic aorta are asymptomatic at incidental diagnosis.  \nThere are multiple diagnostic modalities that may be used in the diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysms. The gold standard is aortography. Contrast enhanced CT may be used as well. MRI and MRA have been particularly useful in defining vascular anatomy. Trans-thoracic echocardiography has limited accuracy in diagnosis of aneurysms, but trans-esophogeal echocardiography is quite accurate. \nTreatment consists of surgery and is recommended if the ascending thoracic aorta is 5.5 cm or greater.

This different primary mechanism of injury necessitates consideration of pulmonary damage due to barotrama secondary to the blast itself.  Further, the patient exhibited multiple additional wounds, consistent with close exposure to an explosive device.  Blast lung, as the condition has been termed, is the second most common manifestation of primary organ damage in blast injuries and is due to the pressure differential across the alveolar-capillary interface.  Pulmonary injury can be sustained without evidence of external thoracic injury when the pressure wave carries sufficient force to compress the chest wall posteriorly against the spine.  The result is a transient elevation in intrathoracic pressure.

Certainly, sand visible within the oral cavity, oropharynx, or nasal passages can be indicative of sand aspiration in the correct clinical context.  Clinical presentation can range from rapid death due to total occlusion of the airway and subsequent anoxic death to a spectrum of dyspnea, cough, and variable obstructive symptoms.1-4  \nIn the past, the focus of reported radiographic imaging in sand aspiration has been on chest x-ray.  Findings on chest roentgenograms may be highly variable, however Bonilla-Santiago described a characteristic “sand bronchogram” in two patients suffering from sand aspiration.2  Both of these patients exhibited particulate matter filling the bronchial tree as evidenced by radiodense material lining the central tracheobronchial tree in one case and linear radiodense opacities in the other.  In reported cases of particulate aspiration following accidental burial or cave-in, similar classic sand bronchograms have been reported.3,4  Other findings on x-ray are highly variable, ranging from near normal imaging to pulmonary edema characterized by fluffy, confluent, nodular perihilar opacities.2,4  The general pattern is that of opacification of the airway involved in aspiration.\nMore recent reports have included CT imaging of sand aspiration, though it is not routinely obtained and reports specifically detailing CT findings are limited in number.4  In a recent retrospective examination of post-mortem CT, as opposed to conventional autopsy in the diagnosis of drowning victims, sand and sediment in the bronchial tree were visualized on nearly half of the drowning victims.5  This finding raises the possibility that sand aspiration has been historically under-recognized in drowning and near-drowning incidents.  \t\nOn CT, it may be possible to appreciate sand bronchograms in the form of radiodense material filling the bronchial tree, similar to those previously described for plain chest films.  These findings may be more apparent in CT imaging when relatively subtle on chest x-ray.4 Additionally, aspirated material may be visible in the trachea as radiodensities, as it was in this case’s presentation.   Findings of air fluid levels in the sinuses, while nonspecific and present in a wide variety of situations, can be suggestive of either drowning or aspirated material.5 Dunagan, et al reported findings of air-fluid-sand levels in the maxillary sinuses in one near drowning patient with sand aspiration.  CT is not routinely recommended in drowings, however, the true utility of CT in these instances has not been determined.3,4  In the setting of conclusive plain film radiographic findings, CT may not be necessary.  \nThere is increasing interest in the use of post-mortem CT in the evaluation of drowning patients which may in time be expanded to use in near-drowning and other causes of sand aspiration with equivocal chest x-ray findings.

The frequency has been reported as between one in 6,000 and one in 55,000 births, and the gene responsible for ARPKD has been linked to the short arm of chromosome 6.  \n\nIn the kidney, ARPKD manifests as nonobstructive collecting duct ectasia. Usually affecting both kidneys, the kidneys are enlarged, and the collecting ducts are dilated, elongated, and fibrosis develops in the renal interstitium.  Clinically, this is manifested as hypertension, diminished urinary concentrating ability, and renal insufficiency and/or failure requiring dialysis or renal transplantation.  Severe renal disease predominates in the very young infant, and may be seen in utero accompanied by oligohydramnios from decreased fetal urine production, with resultant pulmonary hypoplasia, and many infants die shortly after birth.  For those patients with mild renal involvement most will develop some degree of renal insufficiency, and some will progress to renal failure.\n\nLiver disease is inevitably found in patients with ARPKD, with variable severity, involving the bile ducts and portal tracts.  The bile ducts are abnormally formed, increased in number, and dilated, and the portal tracts are enlarged and fibrotic. This pattern is known as congenital hepatic fibrosis, and is always present in ARPKD, although is not by itself diagnostic of the disease.  Generally, the liver is not enlarged, the hepatic parenchyma is normal, and there is normal hepatocellular function.  The hepatic involvement is progressive, with patients commonly presenting between the ages of 5 and 13 years with resultant portal hypertension, splenomegaly, varices, and gastroesophageal hemorrhage. Interestingly, when the bile ducts are macroscopically dilated, ARPKD in the liver may be indistinguishable from Caroli disease.  Further complications include ascending cholangitis, secondary to entry of nonsterile gastrointestinal contents into the dilated intrahepatic bile ducts.\n\nDisease manifestations and clinical presentations vary considerably, and ARPKD is viewed as a spectrum of kidney and liver disease, with renal and hepatic disease inversely proportional to each other in individual patients.  Children with severe kidney disease have mild congenital hepatic fibrosis, and patients with minimal renal disease, may have no renal functional impairment, but rather progressive hepatic fibrosis leading to the development of portal hypertension. \n\nPathogenesis of Renal Involvement:\n\nRenal cysts develop from epithelial proliferation along the collecting duct of the nephron.  Symmetric and circumferential epithelial proliferation results in tubular lengthening and fusiform dilatation of the collecting duct.  The result is that the function of the epithelium changes from resorptive to secretory.  \n\nPathologic Features:\n\nThere are numerous dilated and elongated tubular structures, radially oriented relative to the renal hilum.  Obstruction is not the underlying cause of dilatation; the ‘cysts’ represent dilation and hyperplasia of the interstitial portions of the urteric bud branches that form the collecting ducts.  The kidneys are symmetrically enlarged with a preserved reniform shape, with multiple, tiny cystic spaces throughout.  The elongated, dilated collecting ducts extend from the medulla to the cortex, blurring the corticomedullary junction.\n\nSonography:\n\nAs the spectrum of renal involvement varies, so do the sonographic manifestations of ARPKD.  Neonates and infants with moderate to severe renal disease may demonstrate kidneys that are smoothly enlarged and diffusely echogenic, which is the result of the many interfaces between the radially arrayed dilated ducts and the ultrasound beam.  The degree of enlargement is directly proportional to the number of dilated ducts.  Additionally, numerous, 1-2 mm cystic appearing structures may be identified throughout the cortex and medulla, causing loss of the corticomedullary differentiation.  Occasionally, compressed cortex may be identified at the periphery of the kidney as a hypoechoic thin rim of parenchyma.  Macrocysts may also be evident, becoming larger and more numerous over time.  The bladder is usually small.\n\nThose children who present secondary to portal hypertension have milder renal involvement with normal, or near normal renal function.  The kidneys may appear normal at US, or appear enlarged, echogenic, and have cysts of varying size.  Older children who have progressed to renal fibrosis and demonstrate multiple macrocysts may have sonographic findings that mimic the appearance of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, blurring the diagnosis of ARPKD.\n\nSonographic findings of the hepatobiliary manifestations of ARPKD are also variable.  The liver displays patchy or diffusely increased echogenicity of the portal tracts, representing periportal fibrosis.  The intrahepatic biliary tree may appear normal, or conversely numerous, dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts may be identified.  As patients develop severe portal hypertension, enlarged splenic and portal veins may be demonstrated, and the liver and spleen may become enlarged.  Sonographic evaluation of the portal and splenic veins for direction of flow may assess the progression of portal hypertension.\n\nTreatment:  \n\nTreatment for ARPKD consists of symptomatic management of the sequelae of the disease, such as the control of systemic hypertension with appropriate medication.  Renal failure is treated with dialysis or renal transplantation.  Treatment of the hepatobiliary manifestations of ARPKD consist primarily of controlling variceal bleeding.

Most studies find that the majority of individuals who sustain Achilles tendon injury are men in their third to fifth decade of life, who are participating in sports activities.  The injury most commonly occurs secondary to overloading of the musculotendinous unit in a poorly conditioned individual rather than secondary to an underlying tendinopathy.  The mechanical cause of the injury is most commonly active, forceful plantarflexion, usually associated with pushing off athletic movements.  Less commonly, Achilles rupture is caused by violent unexpected dorsiflexion of a plantarflexed foot, such as when a person steps in hole or falls from a height.(1)\n\n     The diagnsosis can often be made by physical examination.  Findings may include a palpable depression over the area of tendon rupture, weakness of plantarflexion, and positive Thompson test.  A positive Thompson test is failure of the foot to plantarflex when the calf muscles are squeezed.(1)\n\n     However, up to 25% of patients with partial or complete Achilles tear may be misdiagnosed based on physical exam findings alone.  Radiographic findings can assist with the diagnsosis.  When the Achilles tendon is ruptured, the sharp posterior contour of Kager's fat pad triangle will become serrated and indistinct.  The Achilles tendon will appear thickened (> 8mm).  Toygar's angle, which is the angle of the posterior skin surface overlying the distal Achilles and posterior calcaneal surfaces will decrease and is considered abnormal if less than 150 degrees. Positive Arner's sign, in which the anterior contour of the Achilles tendon at the insertion curves away from the superior-posterior aspect of the calcaneus, may be positive.(2)\n\n     MR imaging findings may confirm the diagnosis.  Partial Achilles tendon tears demonstrate heterogeneous signal intensity and thickening of the injured tendon without complete interruption.  Edema manifested as increased T2 signal will usually be present within the tendon, subcutaneous tissues, and in Kager's fat pad.  Hemorrhage signal may also be present in those structures and signal characteristics will vary according to the age of the injury.  Complete Achilles rupture manifests as discontinuity of the tendon with fraying and retraction of the torn edges.  In acute ruptures, the gap between the rupture will have intermediate T1 signal and high T2 signal due to edema and acute hemorrhage.  In chronic ruptures, scar or fat signal will ususally predominate.(3)\n\n     Treatment of Achilles rupture is controversial and there are advantages and disadvantages to conservative nonsurgical treatment versus surgical treatment.  Nonsurgical treatment avoids surgical morbidity and cost, but rerupture rates are as high as 39%.  Surgical treatment has higher cost and morbidity, but lower rerupture rates.(1)", "keywords": "Achillesrupturetear", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1394_synpic22908", "MPX1394_synpic22909"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1394_synpic22908", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1394_synpic22908.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Lateral", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "T1W image demonstrates focal thickening and intermediate signal within the otherwise dark signal of the Achilles tendon", "age": "65", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1394_synpic22909", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1394_synpic22909.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - Other Pulse Seq.", "plane": "Lateral", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "STIR image demonstrates high signal within the Achilles tendon", "age": "65", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nLeft ankle/leg pain and weakness\n\nPhysical Exam:\nWeakness on plantar flexion\n\nImaging Findings:\nPlain radiographs demonstrate thickening of the Achilles tendon, convex impression of Achilles tendon on the posterior margin of Kager's fat pad, and a lower limits normal Toygar's angle. \n\nMR findings demonstrates focal thickening of the Achilles tendon increased T2W signal within the tendon and overlying subcutaneous tissues", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

Interestingly, Achilles tendon xanthomas occur in less than 50% of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and may be imaged using US or MRI.  Other common locations of tendon xanthomas involve the finger extensors on the dorsal aspect of the hands, as well as the plantar fascia, and less commonly the extensor tendons of the toes.\n\nOn radiographs, xanthomas appear as soft-tissue masses without calcification.  Typical sonographic findings include an AP thickness greater than 7 mm in men, and 6 mm in women, as well as the presence of single or multiple hypoechoic foci, which alter the normal appearance of the tendon.  \n\nMRI also demonstrates thickening of the AP diameter, and a speckled appearance to the tendon on both the axial and sagittal views may be noted, but this is not always visualized.  The infiltration of tendon by histiocytes, is responsible for this pattern.  Additionally, the normal concave or flat anterior surface of the Achilles tendon becomes convex in appearance.  MRI is useful in excluding other causes of focal masses in the Achilles tendon such as tendinopathy, tear, infection, gout, or neoplasm.\n\nTendon xanthomas can decrease in size with appropriate treatment of the serum cholesterol levels.", "keywords": "XanthomaAchilles’-Tendon XanthomaAchilles’-Tendon Xanthoma in Familial Hypercholesterolemia", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2193_synpic42191", "MPX2193_synpic42192", "MPX2193_synpic42193", "MPX2193_synpic42194", "MPX2193_synpic42195", "MPX2193_synpic42196", "MPX2193_synpic42197"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2193_synpic42191", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2193_synpic42191.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "There is a multilobulated mass, measuring 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm at the anterior aspect of the right fibula, that is isointense on T1, with no associated bony erosion.", "age": "51", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.6", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2193_synpic42192", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2193_synpic42192.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "There is a multilobulated mass, measuring 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm at the anterior aspect of the fibula, that is isointense on T1, with no associated bony erosion.

At that time, each neural segment is at the exact same level as the corresponding segment of the spinal canal.  Each nerve root extends directly laterally to its neural foramen.  As the embryo matures, the most distal portion of the cord undergoes a process known as retrogressive differentiation.  In this process, the most distal fibers degenerate and elongate.  At the same time, the vertebral bodies are growing more quickly than the cord.  This combination of factors results in a relative ascent of the spinal cord within the spinal canal.  The precise level of the conus medullaris within the spinal canal at the time of birth is debated.  However, it has been established that the conus is usually positioned at the L1-L2 level by the age of 3 months.  The conus is generally considered abnormal if it extends below the bottom of L2.\n\nIn some patients, the process of retrogressive differentiation goes awry.  In these patients the conus medullaris remains below the bottom of L2.  As a consequence, the distal spinal cord is stretched and does not function normally.  \n\nPatients with tethered spinal cords can present at any age.  All patients tend to suffer from difficulty with locomotion, ranging from muscle stiffness to actual weakness.  All patients have abnormal lower extremity reflexes.  The patients can also exhibit bladder dysfunction, sensory changes, and orthopedic deformities of the lower extremities (most commonly club foot).  Back pain and radiculopathy are also common complaints; in fact,  most adults with tethered cords present with radiculopathy.\n\nThe diagnosis of a tethered spinal cord is easily made with MR.  The major findings are the conus medullaris ending below the bottom of L2 and a thickened filum terminale.  The normal filum terminale measures less than or equal to 2 mm in diameter at the L5- S1 level.  A word of caution should be issued concerning identification of the level of the conus medullaris.  On sagittal images, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate the bottom of the spinal cord from the proximal cauda equina.  Therefore, it is advisable to obtain axial, T1-weighted images if there is any question whatsoever about the level of the conus.  It should be noted that approximately 25% of patients with tethering of the spinal cord will have a mild dilatation of the central canal of the distal cord.  This mild dilatation does not represent frank syringohydromyelia and does not need to be directly treated.  Often, this mild dilatation will go away after treatment of the tethered cord.", "keywords": "dysraphismlipomyelomeningocelespina bifida", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2021_synpic19649", "MPX2021_synpic19650", "MPX2021_synpic19651", "MPX2021_synpic19656"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2021_synpic19649", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2021_synpic19649.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A lipoma with chemical shift artifact and fibrous attachment to cord is present at L23 along with a second lipoma of the filum terminale.", "age": "0", "sex": "N/A", "acr_codes": "3.1", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2021_synpic19650", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2021_synpic19650.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A lipoma with chemical shift artifact and fibrous attachment to cord is present at L23 along with a second lipoma of the filum terminale.", "age": "0", "sex": "N/A", "acr_codes": "3.1", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2021_synpic19651", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2021_synpic19651.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A lipoma with chemical shift artifact and fibrous attachment to cord is present at L23 along with a second lipoma of the filum terminale.", "age": "0", "sex": "N/A", "acr_codes": "3.1", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2021_synpic19656", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2021_synpic19656.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A lipoma with chemical shift artifact and fibrous attachment to cord is present at L23 along with a second lipoma of the filum terminale.", "age": "0", "sex": "N/A", "acr_codes": "3.1", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n17 Year old who at age 10 underwent surgery fo a tethered cord.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nWell healed incision.

They account for less than 10 percent of central nervous system (CNS) lesions and 25 percent of spinal cord tumors. The incidence of these tumors is approximately equal between males and females. The median age at diagnosis is five years of age with 25-40% of patients being less than two years old. Ependymomas typically arise within or adjacent to the ependymal lining of the ventricular system; they occasionally occur within the brain parenchyma, and rarely outside the CNS. In children, approximately 90 percent of ependymomas are intracranial (60 percent in the posterior fossa); the remainder arise within the spinal cord. In adults, approximately 75 percent arise within the spinal canal. The fourth ventricle is the most common infratentorial site and extension into the subarachnoid space occurs frequently. Supratentorial lesions can be either intraventricular (most commonly in the lateral ventricles) or parenchymal.  The biology and natural history of ependymomas resemble those of low-grade gliomas; as a result, local growth is predominant and less than 5 percent present with metastatic disease.\n\nEpendymomas are usually well demarcated with frequent areas of calcification, hemorrhage, and cysts. Ependymomas span a histologic appearance from low grade (WHO grade II) differentiated lesions (ependymoma or myxopapillary ependymoma) to anaplastic (WHO grade III) tumors. Rarer subtypes of ependymoma include cellular, papillary, and clear cell variants. Myxopapillary ependymoma is composed of morphologically distinct cells from nonmyxopapillary or regular ependymoma. It arises within the region of the conus medullaris and filum terminale and appears much less malignant than does regular ependymoma. These lesions are classified as grade I, or low grade.\n\nThe clinical presentation of ependymoma is dependent upon tumor location. Most patients with posterior fossa lesions have evidence of increased intracranial pressure. As a result, headache, nausea and vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, and papilledema are common at presentation. Cranial nerve palsies are very common, especially involving cranial nerves VI to X. Brain stem invasion may occur. Seizures or focal neurologic deficits are most prominent when the tumors arise in the supratentorial compartment. Tumors involving the spinal cord present with deficits related to involvement of ascending or descending nerve tracts, or exiting peripheral nerves, that are specific to the level of the tumor.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for tumors that present in the posterior fossa includes medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, and brain stem or choroid plexus tumors. In the supratentorial location, glial tumors, PNETs, and choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma should be considered. The CT appearance is often hyperdense with homogeneous enhancement; cysts and calcifications are common. The presence of calcifications within a tumor located in the fourth ventricle is highly suggestive but not diagnostic of ependymoma. On MRI, these tumors have a hypointense appearance on T1, and are hyperintense on T2 or proton density images; gadolinium enhancement is usually prominent. A subependymoma should be suspected in adults who present with a long clinical history and evidence of a non-enhancing, well-demarcated, nodular intraventricular tumor that is isodense on CT, and isointense in T1 and hyperintense in T2-weighted images on MRI. Stereotactic biopsy or surgical resection are necessary for the diagnosis of ependymoma. All patients should have spinal imaging of the entire neuraxis by MRI to exclude metastatic disease, since up to 10 percent of patients have evidence of spinal seeding.\n\nStandard therapy for ependymoma consists of resection, usually followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy does not appear to play an important role in the management of these tumors in adults but does in children. \n\nIt is difficult to estimate prognosis precisely in patients with ependymoma. In addition to tumor location, the extent of surgical resection and grade of malignancy have been identified as important factors in some studies. Approximately 90 percent of recurrences are local, underscoring the importance of local therapy to outcome. Supratentorial tumors appear to have a better prognosis than those located infratentorially. The risk of recurrence with myxopapillary and subependymoma is low and the prognosis is generally excellent for patients with these low grade tumors. High grade ependymomas are associated with poor outcome in most studies. In children, better performance status and older age are also associated with better prognosis. Compared to older children, infants may do less well partly because they have a higher incidence of infratentorial tumors, and partly because they tend not to receive timely adjuvant radiotherapy due to toxic effects on brain development.", "keywords": "ependymomaCNS", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1420_synpic19078", "MPX1420_synpic19079", "MPX1420_synpic19080", "MPX1420_synpic19081"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1420_synpic19078", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1420_synpic19078.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Sagittal T1WI of the cervical spine demonstrates a multilobulated mass in the inferior aspect of the fourth ventricle.

{"uid": "MPX1094", "title": "Fronto-nasal encephalocele", "history": "8 year old female from the Pacific Islands with an encephalocele", "exam": "", "findings": "There is an encephalocele in the frontal region, extending into the nasion.\nThere is a small fluid collection (syringohydromyelia) in the thoracic spinal cord.", "differential_diagnosis": "", "diagnosis": "Fronto-nasal encephalocele", "diagnosis_by": "Imaging findings", "treatment": "", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Fronto-nasal encephalocele", "acr_code": "1.1", "category": "Congenital, malformation", "disease_discussion": "The term cephalocele refers to a defect in the skull and dura with extracranial extension of intracranial structures.  The term encephalocele refers to herniation of both brain tissue and meninges through the skull defect, whereas the term meningocele refers to herniation of the meninges only.  Both the skull defect and herniation are more common in the midline.  \n\nMost encephaloceles are easily recognized by the clinician.  On initial examination, the patient has a large midline extracranial mass that is soft to palpation.  In patients with obvious masses such as these, the imaging study is obtained to look for associated brain anomalies that may alter the child's prognosis.  An example of such an associated anomaly is shown in Films .3 - .6.  This patient with a large frontal encephalocele also has agenesis of the corpus callosum and multiple gray matter heterotopias in the subependymal region.  The absence of the corpus callosum can be detected on both the sagittal images by the absence of the corpus on the midline image and on the axial images by the characteristic shape of the frontal horns and the parallel lateral ventricles.\n\nAnother reason to obtain imaging studies in patients with encephaloceles is to look for the location of the major vascular structures of the brain.  Particularly, because most encephaloceles are in the midline, the torcula and the superior sagittal sinus are crucial structures that must be located.  In Films .7 - .9, a parietal encephalocele is shown.  This case has two very important findings.  The first is the deformity of the brain in the region of the encephalocele.  Notice how the midbrain and cerebellum are stretched toward the calvarial defect.  This stretching results from the pulsations of the brain causing it to be pushed out of the calvarial defect.  The immature brain (before myelination) is very soft and easily deformed.  Therefore it can be molded into just about any shape.  It is common to see this sort of stretching of brain toward the skull defect in patients with encephaloceles.  The other important feature of this case is the position of the superior sagittal sinus.  On sequential coronal films, going from front to back, the sagittal sinus can be visualized in its entirety in relation to the encephalocele.  Arrows point to the sinus as it courses within the most inferior and lateral aspect of the sac on the right.  Notice that the sinus would be outside of the calvarium if the calvarium were present.  More posteriorly, the torcula is high and the straight sinuses are seen to course steeply inferiorly within the walls of the tentorium cerebellum (arrows).  The steep leaves of the tentorium probably result from the same process that causes herniation of the midbrain and cerebellum into the calvarial defect.  \n\nSpecial mention should be made of sphenoidal and fronto-nasal encephaloceles because they are often clinically occult at birth.  A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of encephalocele in adolescents and young adults who present with nasal or nasopharyngeal masses.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1094_synpic19922", "MPX1094_synpic19923", "MPX1094_synpic21793"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1094_synpic19922", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1094_synpic19922.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W w/Gadolinium", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Generalized", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial and sagittal T1 weighted images post gadolinium enhancement demonstrate an encephalocele in the frontal region, which extends into the nasion.
