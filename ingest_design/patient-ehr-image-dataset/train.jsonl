Pt improved s/p surgery and is doing well.", "discussion": "Hepatocellular adenomas (HA) are usually large, fatty, well circumscribed, nonlobulated, encapsulated tumors.  HA are typically solitary in nature, but ~20% are multiple.  They typically do not have bile ducts or portal vein areas.  They are typically rows of heapatocytes.  HA can develop central necrosis and hemorrhage because the vascular supply is often restricted to the outer surface of the tumor.  Typically in young woman using oral contraceptives pills (OCP) HA is one of the more common hepatic neoplasm as in this patient.  Also, individuals with hemochromatosis , glycogen storage disease, acromegaly, and anabolic steroids users with a hepatic mass are likely to be HA as well.  Some believe that the OCP & anabolic steroids lead to generalized vascular ectasia of the liver leading to the development of HA.  80% of adenomas are solitary and 20% are multiple.\n\nComputed Tomography (CT) in triple phase liver dedicated study demonstrate most HA as a lesion with homogeneous enhancement in the late arterial phase, that will stay isodense to the liver in later phases.  However, these findings in the late arterial phase are not specific to adenomas, since hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hemangiomas, hypervascular metastases, & focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) can show similar enhancement in the arterial phase.  The finding of hemorrhage as an area of high attenuation can be seen in as many as 40% of adenomas.  Fat deposition within adenomas is often difficult to identify on CT and is better visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nDue to the risk of intraperitoneal hemorrhage of the HA & the rare occurrence of malignant transformation to HCC, surgical resection has been advocated as the best solution for patients with presumed HA as was done in this case.  Percutaneous fine needle biopsy of a mass suspicious for HA is controversial because of a significant risk hemorrhage & difficult to distinguish from FNH histologically (FNH does not require surgical resection), however, was still performed in this case, but diagnosis could not be made from biopsy.    Also, HA may also decrease in size if not disappear after OCPs have been stopped, in this pt the lesion was felt to be too large to pursue this treatment.  \n\nReference:\nRichard Baron. “Liver : Masses Part II : common liver tumors”.

Like primary and other secondary cerebral vasculitis, postpartum cerebral angiopathy may cause ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and neurological deficits.  More commonly, secondary cerebral angiopathy occurs in the setting of other medical conditions such as infections, systemic vasculitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis & polyarteritis), connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus & rheumatoid arthritis), medications, illicit drugs, carcinomas (lymphoma & leukemia), and Behcet’s disease.  Other conditions, therefore, need to be ruled out before a diagnosis of postpartum cerebral angiopathy can be made including preeclampsia /eclampsia. \n\n  Contrast catheter angiography and magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) are the typical imaging modalities used to help with the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis although, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and Indium-labelled white cell nuclear scanning may provide some benefit.  Definitive diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis is typically made by biopsy of brain. \n\n  In this patient she presented to the ER with the “worse headache of her life” on the right side 4 days postpartum.  Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with the right sylvian fissure and the sulci of the right frontal lobe.  Further vascular studies including a CT angiogram (CTA), contrast angiography, and MRA showed no evidence of an intracerebral aneurysm.  The patient had no history of hypertension and was not hypertensive during the headache.  She was tested several times throughout pregnancy with no evidence of elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, or headaches looking for preeclampsia.  The patient had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 56 mm/hour.  \n\nUpon further investigation the patient had a contrast enhanced angiogram which showed irregular variable caliber vessels with “sausage linked” appearance in the cortical branches of both the middle cerebral arteries with a more prominence on the right side as opposed to the left.  The MRI also showed and acute 5 mm left cerebellar infarct located within a superior cerebellar artery vascular territory and multiple nonspecific small foci of increased FLAIR signal within the anterior aspects of the external capsule bilaterally.  \n\nThis patient had several classic imaging findings of cerebral vasculopathy of small vessel ischemic disease, SAH, and cortical enhancement.  She had no known significant past medical history including autoimmune disorders, systemic vasculitis, or connective tissue disorders.

Like primary and other secondary cerebral vasculitis, postpartum cerebral angiopathy may cause ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and neurological deficits. More commonly, secondary cerebral angiopathy occurs in the setting of other medical conditions such as infections, systemic vasculitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis & polyarteritis), connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus & rheumatoid arthritis), medications, illicit drugs, carcinomas (lymphoma & leukemia), and Behcet’s disease. Other conditions, therefore, need to be ruled out before a diagnosis of postpartum cerebral angiopathy can be made including preeclampsia /eclampsia. \n\nContrast catheter angiography and magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) are the typical imaging modalities used to help with the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis although, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and Indium-labelled white cell nuclear scanning may provide some benefit. Definitive diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis is typically made by biopsy of brain. \n\nIn this patient she presented to the ER with the “worst headache of her life” on the right side 4 days postpartum. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with the right sylvian fissure and the sulci of the right frontal lobe. Further vascular studies including a CT angiogram (CTA), contrast angiography, and MRA showed no evidence of an intracerebral aneurysm. The patient had no history of hypertension and was not hypertensive during the headache. She was tested several times throughout pregnancy with no evidence of elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, or headaches looking for preeclampsia. The patient had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 56 mm/hour. \n\nUpon further investigation the patient had a contrast enhanced angiogram which showed irregular variable caliber vessels with “a sausage link” appearance in the cortical branches of both the middle cerebral arteries, more prominent on the right side as opposed to the left. The MRI also showed an acute 5 mm left cerebellar infarct located within a superior cerebellar artery vascular territory and multiple nonspecific small foci of increased FLAIR signal within the anterior aspects of the external capsule bilaterally. \n\nThis patient had several classic imaging findings of cerebral vasculopathy of small vessel ischemic disease, SAH, and cortical enhancement. She had no known significant past medical history including autoimmune disorders, systemic vasculitis, or connective tissue disorders.

Common sites of occurrence include the femoral neck and calcaneus. They can also occur in the flat bones, the pelvis, and other locations. \nHistopathologically, intraosseous lipomas are categorized into three types: stage 1, solid tumor composed of viable lipocytes; stage 2, transitional cases with partial fat necrosis and focal calcification intermixed with regions of viable lipocytes; and stage 3, advanced cases in which fat cells have died with variable degree of cyst formation, calcification, and reactive new bone formation. The progression from stage 1 to stage 3 is caused by ischemia and infarction within the lesion and is thought to be related to the rigid structure of bone opposing the lesion’s fat cell expansion and multiplication. These lesions may also cause resorption and expansion of bone, whereas bone infarcts do not cause expansion of the bone.\n  The radiographic features of intraosseous lipomas are based upon the histologic stage of the lesion. The stage 1 lesions are lucent and represent viable fat with resorption of bony trabeculae. Stage 2 lesions have lucent areas, which consist of viable fat and radiodense areas that consist of fat necrosis and dystrophic calcification. Stage 2 lesions can be expansile. Stage 3 lesions reflect resorption of normal bone, but they are more radiodense than stage 1 or 2 lesions. The radiodensity is a result of calcification and extensive fat necrosis. Stage 3 lesions also have thick sclerotic borders, presumably related to involution of these lesions. Radiologically, the differential diagnosis of intraosseous lipomas includes fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cysts, simple bone cysts, bone infarcts, chondroid tumors, and liposclerosing myxofibrous tumors. \n  On CT, stage 1 intraosseous lipomas exhibit resorption of bone trabeculae in the lesion and bone expansion. The area of lucency seen on the radiograph corresponds to fat attenuation visible on CT. Stage 2 lesions have areas of fat attenuation and patchy areas of increased density corresponding to calcification and fat necrosis. Stage 3 intraosseous lipomas are the most difficult to diagnose because of the reactive ossification, calcification, fat necrosis, and cyst formation caused by necrosis of the fat component. If the lesion has a peripheral rim of discernible fat, it will help to eliminate other conditions generally considered in the differential diagnosis. Lesions that exhibit resorption of trabecular bone and predominantly central calcification instead of peripheral calcification are more likely to be stage 3 intraosseous lipomas than bone infarcts; the latter are non-expansile lesions that have a peripheral serpentine thin rim of sclerosis and are not associated with trabecular resorption. \n  MR imaging reveals viable fat in stage 1 intraosseous lipomas. The fat is isointense to subcutaneous fat on T1-weighted sequences and exhibits low signal intensity with fat suppression on T2-weighted images. A thin circumferential rim of low signal intensity on T1- and T2- weighted sequences is typically present demarcating the margin of the fatty lesion consistent with reactive sclerosis surrounding the lesion. In stage 2 lesions, one can again identify fat and the circumferential rim of decreased signal on T1- and T2-weighted images. Low-signal-intensity areas within the central portion of the lesion on T1- and T2-weighted images are consistent with calcifications.  Stage 3 lesions show a thin peripheral rim of fat, which can be identified on MR imaging. They also have central calcification and a thick rim of surrounding sclerosis, which have low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences.

Men are affected twice as often as women, and lesions are usually discovered in the 4th 5th decades of life. Soft-tissue components may also be associated with these lesions. Osseous hemangioma is particularly common in the spine and calvaria and less frequently affects long bones such as the tibia, femur, and humerus. \n\nOsseous hemangiomas may have radiating trabecular thickening on radiographs. Another common pattern is a bubbly bone lysis that creates a honeycomb, latticelike, or \"hole-within-hole\" appearance. These lytic areas are invariably multifocal and usually metaphyseal or epiphyseal. Bone lysis can have linear and circular components on radiographs, suggestive of a vascular lesion, with linear and circular elements representing vascular channels seen longitudinally and en face, respectively. However, these serpentine vascular channels are recognized more easily with CT and MR imaging. Characteristically, these channels have low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images because of slow blood flow. In arteriovenous lesions with faster blood flow, low signal intensity may persist with all MR imaging pulse sequences.

Chance in 1948, are horizontal vertebral fractures that extend through the vertebral body, pedicles and  to the spinous process or lamina.   The plain films are characteristic of wedge compression fractures while the posterior components are displaced to varying degrees.  The posterior displacements are often better visualized on MRI and more specifically CT.  CT with sagittal reconstructions are recommended.  \n\nChance fractures commonly occur at the thoracic/lumbar junction where the spine transitions from a rigid to a more flexible segment.  The etiology of these fractures is most often hyperflexion of the back.  With the increasing use of lap seat belts in the 1950s-70s these fractures became known as “seat belt” fractures as vehicle accidents would cause sudden flexion of the waist at the thoracic/lumbar junction inducing significant stress on the posterior column.  With the addition of shoulder belts these injuries have become significantly less common.  Most Chance fractures seen today are a result of falls or crush type injuries where the spine is acutely hyperflexed.  Intraabdominal injuries are likely in approximately 50% of chance fractures so vigilance should be given to a thorough evaluation involving a CT of the abdomen.  \n\nMost Chance Fractures are managed with immobilization.  Instability is frequently associated with a kyphosis of 20° or more and a kyphosis of 30° or more usually requires internal stabilization.

The presentation is most commonly of the exostotic type, as a large calcified mass in a vertebral body developing into the paraspinal tissue.  The center of the tumor is often calcified with stippling and mottling with underlying bone distruction with a thick cap of sarcomatous cartilage surrounding the calcified mass. The causes include de novo appearance, malignant transformation of an enchondroma, or development from the cartilaginous cap of an osteochondroma.  The clinical hx is often one of an indolent pain, swelling, with a progressive increase in size to the point of compression of neighboring organs, nerve root, or spinal cord compression.  The cartilage emits a high T2 signal on MRI.  Treatment is radical surgical resection due to the fact that the tumor is very refractory to chemotherapy.

It accounts for 4% of all osteogenic sarcomas. The classic location for a parosteal osteosarcoma is the posterior distal metaphysis of the femur; however, it may also arise in the posterior metaphysis of the proximal tibia and the proximal metaphysis of the humerus, and rarely elsewhere. It is slow-growing but has a tendency to recur after inadequate excision, and it may metastasize. The lesion arises from the outer fibrous layer of periosteum. Common presenting symptoms are aching or limited range of motion due to interference with a joint. \n\nThe tumor merges with the cortex by a stalk early on in the disease process and has a broad base later on in the progression. The bone marrow of the bone does not extend into the base of the tumor. Although, there may be occasional medullary involvement by the tumor.  Radiographically it is a broad-based, juxtacortical, densely ossified mass, the periphery somewhat less dense that the base. CT scan is most useful and can demonstrate a radiolucent zone of periosteum and fibrous tissue trapped between the tumor and cortex.

Myositis ossificans is more densely calcified at its periphery and usually does not involve the adjacent cortex. With an osteochondroma the stalk of an exostosis is contiguous with the cortex of the bone from which it arises and the medullary bone within the stalk is also contiguous with that of the adjacent bone. Chondroid calcification within the cartilaginous cap may be present and is also distinctive.\n\nParosteal osteosarcoma has a relatively good prognosis compared to conventional osteosarcoma.

Risk factors include the typical thrombosis risk factors such as pregnancy, OCP use, smoking, dehydration, and the hypercoaguable disorders.  \n\nRadiographic findings include hyperdense venous structures.  One should be aware of a few diagnostic pitfalls, such as normally dense venous structures.  These structures can be more dense with dehydration or elevated hematocrit, but the density is concerning when the venous structures are more dense than arteries on non-contrast CT scans.  Other findings, such as infarct and hemorrhage, if present, can also help confirm a diagnosis of a venous sinus thrombosis.  CT angiography and MR venography (MRV) can be used to verify findings.

It is an uncommon disorder (2-7 per million) which can have serious complications.  Causal factors include local (regional infection, trauma, neoplasm) and systemic (dehydration, hypercoagulable states, pregnancy, oral contraceptives).  Clinical presentation includes headache, neurologic deficits or seizures.  The superior sagittal sinus is most commonly affected, followed by the transverse and sigmoid sinuses.  Complications include venous infarcts, intracerebral hemorrhage and intracranial hypertension.\n\nOn noncontrast CT, the thombosed sinus is usually hyperdense.  This is nonspecific as dehydrated patients, adjacent subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage or elevated hematocrit can cause increased sinus attenuation.  On contrast enhanced CT, the empty delta sign is a central defect from thrombus surrounded by contrast enhanced blood.  On MRI, absence of a flow void or abnormal signal within the sinus is seen. \n\nMR venography with two-dimensional time-of-flight is used due to high sensitivity for slow flow compared to 3D TOF.

They are benign neoplasms of endothelial origin; most commonly seen in young and middle aged adults.  They are the most common primary cerebellar neoplasm in adults 40-60 years old.  Among patients with hemangioblastoma, 25 percent occur in those with von Hippel-Lindau disease. On the other hand, hemangioblastomas are the most common lesions associated with VHL disease, eventually affecting 44 to 80 percent of patients. Sporadic hemangioblastoma are usually solitary; multiple tumors within the neuraxis should raise suspicion for VHL disease.\nHemangioblastomas cause neurologic deficits, both by direct compression or tumor-associated hemorrhage. The specific deficit from direct compression depends upon tumor location, and may include cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor nerve dysfunction, motor weakness, or sensory deficits. Patients with spinal hemangioblastomas frequently present with pain.  Secondary to this associated risk of hemorrhage, surgical treatment is indicated, as in this patient.\n\nThe diagnostic procedure of choice is gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The classic appearance is a well-defined cystic mass with an intensely enhancing mural nodule (60% of cases).  Because the tumor nodule receives it’s blood supply from the pia mater, the nodule, which represents the tumor itself, is almost always superficial.  Up to 40% are entirely solid.  In these cases, the margins can be ill-defined and occasionally can see hemorrhage.  Surrounding edema may be present.  Flow voids within the nodule may be present.\n\nAn acute hemorrhage secondary to hemangioblastoma can be catastrophic.  Intracerebral bleeding from a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may cause rapid obstructive hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, brainstem compression, or uncal herniation. Bleeding from a spinal hemangioblastoma may result in acute quadriplegia or paraplegia from hemorrhage into the spinal cord.  Headache, back pain, or radiculopathy can result from subarachnoid hemorrhage. In these situations, emergency neurosurgical intervention is indicated.\n\nReferences:\nBrant WE, Helms CA.

They are not malformations.  They account for less than 3% of all intracranial neoplasms (1).  These tumors are most common  in  young  and middle-aged  adults,  where the incidence in males exceeds that of females (2).  The cerebellar hemisphere is the most common location, although they may be located in  the  spinal  cord,  brain stem,  or cerebral  hemispheres.    Ten percent of hemangioblastomas occur as part of the von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n\nSixty percent of these tumors are cystic, as in this case.  The enhancing mural nodule is a common finding in hemangioblastoma.  At CT,  the  cystic  portion of the tumor appears low density and does not enhance, while the  mural  nodule  enhances  homogeneously  and intensely.  The  MR  findings,  as  seen  in this case, include a predominantly cystic tumor with long  T1  and  long  T2  relaxation times,  and  intense enhancement of the peripheral nodule following gadolinium administration.  If the vascular nodule has bled  or  is proteinaceous,  it  may  be  hyperintense  on  short TR precontrast sequences.  More than one  enhancing  tumor  nodule  may  be  seen. Forty  percent  of hemangioblastomas are solid and display variable degrees of contrast enhancement.\n\nLateral  projections of a left vertebral artery subtraction angiogram (arterial and venous phases) in another patient with hemangioblastoma are shown in Films .6 and .7.  The angiographic findings are characteristic for a hemangioblastoma.  Notice the focal  enhancing nodule  fed  predominantly  by  the  superior cerebellar artery and seen densely enhancing in the arterial phase.   Because of  significant  artifact  in  the  posterior  fossa on CT, a small peripheral nodule may be missed and angiography is felt to be more sensitive  than  contrast  CT scan for detecting nodules.  MRI with Gd-DTPA may replace angiography for  evaluation  of  patients  with suspected hemangioblastoma.\n\nvon  Hippel-Lindau  disease  is  an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete and variable penetrance (3).  The incidence is equal in males and females.  Multiple lesions have been reported in  this syndrome,  but  the  most important lesions which cause significant morbidity include retinal angiomatosis, cerebellar or  spinal  cord hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.  Over  50% of patients with this syndrome have hemangioblastomas of the retina, which may present with acute or  chronic  retinal  detachment.  Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals these lesions, and radiographic evaluation plays a small role.\n\nThirty-six  to sixty percent of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have cerebellar hemangioblastoma.  Signs and symptoms due  to  this tumor  are  the  most common cause for patients to present with the syndrome.\n\nAlthough  the reported occurrence of spinal cord hemangioblastoma is 5%, autopsy data  and  MRI  suggest  the  incidence  may  be higher (4,5).    Signs and symptoms of a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may be dramatic, and neurologic deficit from a spinal  cord  lesion may  be overlooked.  Typical MR findings in a spinal cord hemangioblastoma include syringomyelia,  enhancing  nodule,  and  enlarged feeding and draining vessels.  \n\nTwenty-five  to  thirty-eight  percent  of  patients  with  von Hippel-Lindau disease will develop renal cell carcinoma, which may be multiple  and bilateral.   Pheochromocytoma is found in 10% of patients with this disease.\n\nOther  lesions  in  von  Hippel-Lindau  disease include angiomas of the liver and kidney and cysts of  the  pancreas,  liver,  kidney  and epididymis.  \n\nRoutine  screening  of  family  members  of  a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease has been  recommended.    MRI  with  Gd-DTPA  is  the procedure of choice to screen for CNS involvement.\n\nIn  the  adult, the  differential diagnosis for a cystic mass in the posterior fossa includes a simple arachnoid cyst or  a  cerebellar astrocytoma.    A  simple  arachnoid  cyst  is extra- axial and will not demonstrate an enhancing  nodule,  although  such  a  nodule  may  be  seen  in  a cerebellar  astrocytoma.  Since 40% of cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be solid, this lesion should be included in the differential of a solid or partially solid mass  in  the  posterior  fossa  in  the adult.  These lesions   are   uncommon   in   children, and medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or astrocytoma are more likely than a cerebellar hemangioblastoma when a posterior fossa mass is seen in a child.", "keywords": "hemangioblastoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2336_synpic49838"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2336_synpic49839", "MPX2336_synpic49840", "MPX2336_synpic49841"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2336_synpic49838", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2336_synpic49838.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "CT: Well-marginated low-density cystic appearing cerebellar mass with a mural nodule.", "age": "33", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2336_synpic49839", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2336_synpic49839.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1 hypointense cystic cerebellar lesion with isointense mural nodule.", "age": "33", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2336_synpic49840", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2336_synpic49840.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1 hypointense cystic cerebellar lesion with isointense mural nodule", "age": "33", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2336_synpic49841", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2336_synpic49841.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 hyperintense cystic component with isointence mural nodule.", "age": "33", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n33 y/o man with complaints of nonspecific headaches, without focal neurological finding.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nSubjective headaches, without focal neurological finding on examination.\n\nImaging Findings:\n•  CT: Well-marginated low-density cystic appearing cerebellar mass with a mural nodule. \n\n•  MRI: T1 hypointense / T2 Hyperintense cystic cerebellar lesion with isointense mural nodule.", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

They consist of large sinusoidal vascular spaces which lack normal endothelial tight juctions.  As a result, bleeding is frequent.  The majority of bleeds from these lesions, however, are subclinical with nearly 100% demonstrating hemosiderin staining of the adjacent parenchyma at diagnosis.  There is a 0.5-1% incidence of symptomatic hemmorhage/year.  The most common clinical presentation as a result of hemmorhage is the development of seizures or progressive neurologic deficits, with a seizure disorder being the presenting symptom in approximately 50% of patients with cavernous angiomas.  The degree to which a lesion is symptomatic is,like most CNS abnormalities, dependent on location. Brainstem lesions tend to present earlier with neurologic deficits.\n\nCavernous angiomas may occur anywhere within the CNS with roughly 3/4 occurring supratentorially, 1/4 within the posterior fossa and brainstem, and occasional lesions within the spinal cord.  While the occurrence may be sporadic, there is a strong familial association identified where close to 80% of members of affected families may demonstrate lesions.  In about 50% of patients the lesions will be multiple.  Whenever more than one cavernous malformation is identified in the CNS, there is probably an autosomal dominant inheritence.  This should prompt an evaluation of all first-degree relatives.\n\nImaging findings are related to the degree of prior hemmorhage of the lesions.  On CT, these lesions may be heavily calcified.  MR often demonstrates blood products of various ages centrally and a rim of hemosiderin peripherally.  Gradient-echo images may be helpful in identification of small lesions secondary to the gradient suseptibility or characteristic \"blooming\" artifact produced by hemosiderin.  Following contrast administration, on either CT or MR, variable enhancement may occur.", "keywords": "cavernous angiomacavernoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1563_synpic51033"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1563_synpic51034", "MPX1563_synpic51035"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1563_synpic51033", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1563_synpic51033.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - Montage", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Hyperattenuating lesion left inferior frontal lobe.

Fluctuations or worsening symptoms and sudden improvements are common during the first 24 to 48 hours, probably because of emboli passing distally. Usually embolic infarcts are large, and deficits are more severe in patients with emboli than with in situ occlusions. Single or infrequent but longer lasting TIAs may precede embolic infarctions. Embolic events often occur during activity or sudden straining, coughing, or sneezing. Infarcts may involve multiple vascular territories and are mixed in age. Early angiographic or TCD studies may show the presence of distal intra-arterial emboli. Hemorrhagic conversion of infarcted areas is commonly noted on CT and MRI scans. Infarcts are often wedge-shaped and involve the cerebral cortical surface.(1)\n\nAtrial fibrillation is the underlying cause of 30,000 to 40,000 embolic strokes per year in the United States. The precentage of AF caused strokes increases with age, rising from 1.5 percent in patients aged 50 to 59 years to 23.5 percent in patients aged 80 to 89 years. Although co-morbid conditions such as hypertension and vascular disease are factors, the predominant cause of strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation is embolization of a clot from the left atrium.\n\nWhen evaluated using transesophageal echocardiography, up to 30 percent of patients with atrial fibrillation and embolic stroke are found to have atrial thrombi within 72 hours of the stroke.

On MRI the mass was confirmed to be extraaxial and enhanced avidly.", "differential_diagnosis": "•  Menigioma\n•  Acoustic neuroma\n•  Epidermoid\n•  Arachnoid cyst\n•  Metastasis", "diagnosis": "Cerebellopontine angle meningioma", "diagnosis_by": "", "treatment": "", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Cerebellopontine angle meningioma", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Neoplasm, non-glial", "disease_discussion": "The  CPA  is  the  extra-axial  space triangulated by the pons, cerebellum, and petrous temporal  bone.    Located  within  it  are meningeal layers, cranial nerves 5, 7, and 8, CSF and the flocculus of the cerebellum.  \n\nMeningiomas  arise  from the arachnoid granulation cells within the meningeal layers.  Other lesions in the  CPA,  from  which  they must  be  differentiated, include acoustic schwannoma, epidermoid, trigeminal schwannoma, exophytic brain stem glioma, metastasis, cholesteatoma (acquired), cholesterol granuloma, arachnoid  cyst,  aneurysm, and vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia.\n\nAcoustic  schwannomas are  the most common CPA masses and usually arise from the vestibular division of the 8th cranial nerve  within the  internal  auditory  canal.   They present as a mass within the internal auditory canal and often widen the canal.  Meningiomas, on the other hand, are extrinsic to the internal  auditory  canal  although  they  may compress the 7th-8th nerve complex (see Film 2). Classically, meningiomas are hyperdense compared to gray matter  on noncontrast CT and enhance intensely, whereas acoustic neuromas are isodense  or  hypodense  and  also enhance.  It may be difficult to visualize small acoustic neuromas or meningiomas on CT  because  of artifacts from the adjacent petrous temporal bone. When present, changes in the temporal bone can  be  quite  helpful. Acoustic neuroma will widen or erode the internal auditory canal in up  to  90%  of  cases, although small intracanalicular lesions are increasingly recognized with Gd-DTPA MR  prior  to  development  of internal auditory canal abnormalities.  Meningiomas may demonstrate hyperostosis  of  the  adjacent  temporal  bone.  MRI, without bone artifact, surpasses CT for mass localization relative  to  the  internal  auditory canal, especially with the use of Gd-DTPA.  Acoustic schwannomas are isointense to gray matter on T1-weighted images and enhance  homogeneously after Gd-DTPA.  Meningiomas are iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images and  also  enhance  homogeneously,  but are located outside of the internal auditory canal.  On T2-weighted imaging, meningioma has a  variable signal  while  acoustic  schwannoma is usually increased in intensity. \n\nAngiographically, meningiomas classically have a persistent,  homogeneous blush lasting through the venous phase, which is not typical of  schwannoma or  the  other more common CPA lesions.  CPA masses, if large, enough, can be detected angiographically by characteristic displacement of the adjacent vascular  structures.    Such masses  may  elevate and posteriorly displace the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, elevate the superior cerebellar artery, displace the basilar artery if the mass extends  medially,  or  elevate  and compress the petrosal vein.  \n\nThe  other  lesions  within the differential diagnosis are less common.  Epidermoid tumors result from  epidermal  tissue  that  is included within the neural tube during embryonic development.  They may be markedly hypointense to cortex on T1-weighted MRI images (there are  some  reports  of hyperintense epidermoids on T1 imaging) and are hyperintense compared to CSF on T2 imaging with no  enhancement following  Gd - DTPA.   CT demonstrates a hypodense (density slightly greater than CSF) mass without  enhancement;  thus,  differentiation from  meningioma  is  not  difficult.  Trigeminal neuroma is radiographically  similar  to acoustic neuroma except the course follows that of the 5th cranial nerve and the IAC and 7th/8th  nerve  complex  are  normal.  Exophytic brain stem glioma will have both intra- and extra-axial components by multiplanar  MR  imaging.    Arachnoid cysts  have  imaging  characteristics  paralleling  CSF.   Vascular abnormalities can usually be detected  by  MRI  demonstrating  flow void  and/or  clot.   The flocculus of the cerebellum should not be mistaken for a lesion based on  its  known  anatomic  location  and signal  characteristics.    Metastatic  disease may be difficult to distinguish from benign lesions because of the  varied  appearance, unless  one sees multiple lesions or there is obvious bone destruction, which may require CT demonstration.  Acquired  cholesteatomas may  also require CT evaluation of the temporal bone to demonstrate the characteristic pattern of involvement of the middle  ear  which is   necessary   to  differentiate  these  lesions  from  the  bony destruction caused by metastatic disease.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2453_synpic23426"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2453_synpic23428", "MPX2453_synpic23429"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2453_synpic23426", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2453_synpic23426.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Non-contrast CT of the head demonstrates a slightly hyperdense mass in the left cerebellopontine angle.", "age": "31", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2453_synpic23428", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2453_synpic23428.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial T1 (TR 650 TE10) image demonstrates a mass in the left CP angle which is isointense to grey matter.", "age": "31", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2453_synpic23429", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2453_synpic23429.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W w/Gadolinium", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Post gadolinium axial T1 (TR 500 TE 20) image demonstrates a mass in the left CP angle which enhaces dramatically with contrast.

Variable signal is seen on T1 and T2.  On post contrast imaging enhancement of the involved tissues is seen.\n\n-Allergic Fungal Sinusitis: On CT, allergic fungal sinusitis typically shows high density material within the sinuses.  On MRI there is low T1 and T2 weighted signal in the sinuses. The peripheral inflamed mucosa will enhance on post contrast imaging.\n\n-Mycetoma: In patients who are otherwise healthy, occasionally a mycetoma may develop. This sometimes occurs afer the chang in the local sinus microenvironment, as can be seen after sinus surgery or radiation therapy. This involves one sinonasal cavity, and on CT is seen as a focal mass within the sinus lumen.  It typically has areas of high density and may have calcification.  The adjacent bone is thick and sclerotic as a result of chronic inflammation. After the administration of contrast, the inflamed mucosa at the periphery of the sinus may enhance.  On MRI, a low signal mass on both T1 and T2 is seen within the sinus.  Occasionally, on T2 the signal may be so low as to be mistaken for air.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: \n-Mycetoma: Surgical excision curative\n-Invasive Fungal Sinusitis: Radical debridment, IV amphotericin B, with use of itraconazole as long-term suppressive treatment.  Acute fungal sinusitis is life-threatening and can be lethal within a matter of hours.  \n-Allergic Fungal Sinusitis: May be treated with topical and systemic antifungal agents along with topical steroids and saline irrigation.  Also, may undergo surgical debridement.\n---------------------------------------------------------\neMedicine Topic - http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic510.htm", "keywords": "sinusaspergillosisaspergilis", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1064_synpic41377", "MPX1064_synpic41378"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1064_synpic41380", "MPX1064_synpic41381"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1064_synpic41377", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1064_synpic41377.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Expansion and opacification of frontal sinus, with thinning and disruption of bone comprising the inner table of the frontal bone", "age": "27", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "2.7", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1064_synpic41378", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1064_synpic41378.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Expansion and opacification of ethmoid sinus, with disruption of bone comprising the left lamina papyrecea", "age": "27", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "2.7", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1064_synpic41380", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1064_synpic41380.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Expansion of the frontal sinuses is noted.

The prevalence is often higher in rural areas, particularly where pigs are raised and poor sanitary conditions prevail. Humans develop cysticercosis by ingestion of foods contaminated with the parasites eggs (typically fruits & vegetables), not from eating pork infected with the parasite itself as is popularly believed. Thus, individuals who have never eaten pork can still acquire cysticercosis.\n  \nOnce eggs are ingested by humans, the embryos are released in the small intestine and invade the bowel wall. They then disseminate hematogenously and develop into cysticerci over a period of 3-8 weeks. Cysticerci are liquid-filled vesicles consisting of a membranous wall and a nodule containing the invaginated scolex. The scolex has a head armed with suckers and hooks and a rudimentary body. Humans with cysticercosis are incidental dead end hosts.\n  \nThe most prominent manifestations of cystircercosis infection involve the CNS, a syndrome referred to as neurocysticercosis (NCC) and it is thought to be the most common parasitic infection of the brain.  Clinical syndromes of cysticercosis are therefore often divided into neurocysticercosis and extraneural manifestations.\n  \n80% of neurocysticercal infections are asymptomatic. Consequently, many cases are found accidentally during imaging procedures or at autopsy. When symptoms due occur, they may be due to mass effect, an inflammatory response, or obstruction of foramina and ventricular system of the brain.\n  \nCysticerci that enter the CSF do not initially cause much inflammation. The host develops immune tolerance to the parasite, and cysticerci can remain in this stage for years without eliciting symptoms. Clinical manifestations frequently develop when an inflammatory response develops secondary to a degenerating cysticercus. It is not known what triggers this degeneration, but after a number of years the cyst loses its ability inhibit the host immune response. Peak presentation with NCC is estimated to occur 3-5 years after infection. After a variable period of degeneration, cysts become calcified and inactive. Once inactive, they may cease to cause symptoms or may serve as a focus for epileptic activity.\n  \nActive parenchymal disease is the most common form of NCC and is present in >60 percent of patients. Cysticerci tend to lodge in the cerebral cortex or basal ganglia. The cysts are usually <1 cm. Patients with parenchymal NCC frequently present with seizures, occurring in 50-80% of patients. In many endemic countries, NCC is the most common cause of adult-onset epilepsy. Because of NCC, the prevalence of epilepsy is almost twice as high in developing countries as it is in the Western world.\n  \nNeurologic examinations are usually normal, but focal neurologic signs or headache may be present. Patients rarely have fever or signs of meningeal irritation. If a patient has massive numbers of cysts in the brain parenchyma, an intense immune reaction can occur, resulting in encephalitis. This reaction can occur spontaneously or it can be provoked by therapy. This presentation is most common in children and young females for unknown reasons. \n  \nCysticerci that lodge in the subarachnoid space may grow to 10 cm or more since they are not limited by pressure from the brain parenchyma. Cysticerci can also develop in the ventricles of the brain, either floating freely in the ventricular cavity or attached to the choroid plexus, and is seen in only 10-20% of cases. Mobile cysts in the forth ventricle can occasionally cause intermittent obstruction, leading to episodes of sudden loss of consciousness related to head movements (Bruns' syndrome).    Involvement of the spinal cord occurs in approximately 1-3% of cases of NCC. Spinal cysticerci can be intramedullary or located in the subarachnoid space. \n  \nExtraneural cysticercosis typically involves the eye, muscle, or subcutaneous tissue. Patients with ocular involvement may have parasites located in the subretinal space or vitreous humor. These are often asymptomatic, but inflammation around degenerating cysticerci can threaten vision by causing chorioretinitis, retinal detachment or vasculitis and therefore this entity should be excluded before initiating therapy. Cysticerci also have a predilection for muscle or subcutaneous tissues, however, cysticerci at these sites are usually asymptomatic. \n  \nCalcified cysticercal lesions in muscle or subcutaneous tissue may be seen on routine skeletal radiographs or intracranial calcifications may be seen on skull x-rays.  Any case of suspected NCC needs to be evaluated with a CT scan or MR imaging. The appearance depends upon the location and stage of the lesions and upon the host immune response. In parenchymal NCC, viable cysts are seen as nonenhancing hypodense lesions. Degenerating cysts may enhance with contrast and may have variable degrees of surrounding inflammation. Old cysts often appear as calcified lesions.  MRI is preferred over CT scanning, since MRI is more sensitive in detecting small lesions, brainstem or intraventricular lesions, and is better at visualizing the scolex. MRI is also more useful in evaluating degenerative changes in the parasite. However, CT scanning is better at detecting small areas of calcification.\n  \nA number of different serologic tests have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of cysticercosis. Some tests detect anticysticercal antibodies, and others identify cysticercal antigens. Some can only be performed on blood, while others can done on other fluids, such as CSF or saliva. As with all serologic tests, results need to be interpreted with caution in individuals from highly endemic areas where a positive serology may be due to past infection and may not prove current active disease.", "keywords": "neurocystircercosiscystircercosisparasite", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1609_synpic19713", "MPX1609_synpic19714"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1609_synpic19716", "MPX1609_synpic19717", "MPX1609_synpic19718", "MPX1609_synpic19719", "MPX1609_synpic19720"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1609_synpic19713", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1609_synpic19713.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial CT through the level of the frontal lobes demonstrates a well defined intra-axial cystic lesion with a surrounding rim of edema.", "age": "35", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.6", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1609_synpic19714", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1609_synpic19714.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial CT demonstrates a well defined extra-axial cystic lesion deep within a sulci of the left temporal lobe with no surrounding edema.", "age": "35", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.6", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1609_synpic19716", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1609_synpic19716.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Sagittal T1 weighted image through the parafalcine brain demonstrates an additional cystic lesion along the high convexity that was not appreciated during CT evaluation.

The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related” aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

There is a strong association between subcutaneous sarciodosis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (72.7%). Sarciodosis is a diagnosis of exclusion supported by three elements: 1.

Genetics and host factors also are involved in the pathogenesis of sarciodosis.  In the US, blacks are more frequently affected and the ACCESS trial showed that affected patients were five times more likely than controls to report a sibling with the disease.  Further, recent studies have identified specific genes associated with sarciodosis.  A single-nucleotide polymorphism on the BTNL2 gene may influence T-lymphocyte activation and regulation and make people carrying this polymorphism more susceptible to sarciodosis.  A second gene associated with sarciodosis is Annexin A11 on chromosome 10q22.3 responsible for calcium signaling, cell division and apoptosis.  \n\n\n\nDeficits of this gene have been associated with sarciodosis.  Further, HLA haplotypes and T-cell receptor expression play an intricate role in the development of the disease.\n\nBiomarker screening\nIn an attempt to aid in diagnosis of sarciodosis, investigators continue to search for potential biomarkers in disease activity. Chitotriosidase is an enzyme expressed by activated macrophages and Bargagli et al. found elevated levels of this enzyme in patients with sarciodosis, with >90% exhibiting elevated levels of the marker.  A second marker IL-2, a cytokine that induces T-cell proliferation and activation is elevated in serum of patients with sarciodosis and may have prognostic value.  \n\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of sarciodosis is best supported by a combination of radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy and tissue specimens that show noncaseating granulomas.  Endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration when compared to non-guided transbronchial needle aspiration had a diagnosis yield of 83.3% compared to 53.8%.  \n\nTreatment\nTherapy for patients with chronic sarciodosis requires prolonged treatment often with steroids which cause systemic side effects.  TNF inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment, but a study by Utz et al, found treatment failure in nearly 65% of participants.  A new TNF-alpha antagonist Ustekinumab, approved for dosing in patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; is currently being tested for its efficacy in treatment of sarciodosis with completion of the study anticipated in July 2011.

In the US, blacks are more frequently affected and the ACCESS trial showed that affected patients were five times more likely than controls to report a sibling with the disease.  Further, recent studies have identified specific genes associated with sarcoidosis.  A single-nucleotide polymorphism on the BTNL2 gene may influence T-lymphocyte activation and regulation and make people carrying this polymorphism more susceptible to sarcoidosis.  A second gene associated with sarcoidosis is Annexin A11 on chromosome 10q22.3 responsible for calcium signaling, cell division and apoptosis.  \n\n\nDeficits of this gene have been associated with sarcoidosis.  Further, HLA haplotypes and T-cell receptor expression play an intricate role in the development of the disease.\n\nBiomarker screening:\nIn an attempt to aid in diagnosis of sarcoidosis, investigators continue to search for potential biomarkers in disease activity. Chitotriosidase is an enzyme expressed by activated macrophages and Bargagli et al. found elevated levels of this enzyme in patients with sarcoidosis, with >90% exhibiting elevated levels of the marker.  A second marker IL-2, a cytokine that induces T-cell proliferation and activation is elevated in serum of patients with sarcoidosis and may have prognostic value.  \n\nDiagnosis:\nDiagnosis of sarcoidosis is best supported by a combination of radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy and tissue specimens that show noncaseating granulomas.  Endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration when compared to non-guided transbronchial needle aspiration had a diagnosis yield of 83.3% compared to 53.8%.  \n\nTreatment:\nTherapy for patients with chronic sarcoidosis requires prolonged treatment often with steroids which cause systemic side effects.  TNF inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment, but a study by Utz et al, found treatment failure in nearly 65% of participants.  A new TNF-alpha antagonist Ustekinumab, approved for dosing in patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; is currently being tested for its efficacy in treatment of sarcoidosis with completion of the study anticipated in July 2011.  Surgical indication for patients with sarcoidosis remains controversial.  Surgery has potential to reduce symptoms and decrease need for oral steroids, but does not eradicate or prevent recurrence of disease.  Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone for treatment, but care must be taken to assess for potential adverse effects.", "keywords": "adenopathynon-caseating granulomasneck dissection", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2450_synpic55685"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2450_synpic55646", "MPX2450_synpic55647", "MPX2450_synpic55648", "MPX2450_synpic55649", "MPX2450_synpic55650", "MPX2450_synpic55651"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2450_synpic55685", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2450_synpic55685.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial view displaying bilateral hilar adenopathy", "age": "32", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "9.2", "figure_part": "3b"}, {"image_id": "MPX2450_synpic55646", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2450_synpic55646.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Coronal view showing multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the submandibular and lateral neck area.", "age": "32", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "9.2", "figure_part": "1a"}, {"image_id": "MPX2450_synpic55647", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2450_synpic55647.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Coronal view showing multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the submandibular and lateral neck area.", "age": "32", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "9.2", "figure_part": "1b"}, {"image_id": "MPX2450_synpic55648", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2450_synpic55648.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial view demonstrating per-mandibular burden of enlarged lymph nodes.", "age": "32", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "9.2", "figure_part": "1c"}, {"image_id": "MPX2450_synpic55649", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2450_synpic55649.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial view demonstrating per-mandibular burden of enlarged lymph nodes.", "age": "32", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "9.2", "figure_part": "1d"}, {"image_id": "MPX2450_synpic55650", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2450_synpic55650.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Sagittal view demonstrating enlarged superficial/deep cervical and submandibular lymph nodes.", "age": "32", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "9.2", "figure_part": "1e"}, {"image_id": "MPX2450_synpic55651", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2450_synpic55651.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Sagittal view demonstrating enlarged superficial/deep cervical and submandibular lymph nodes.", "age": "32", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "9.2", "figure_part": "1f"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n32 year old woman with a 2 year history of slowly growing lump on neck along and progressive shortness of breath.

Such complications are postulated to be secondary to physiologic changes in the regional cerebral blood flow surrounding the perinidal tissues.  Proposed solutions to such complications include possible staged emobolization procedures such to produce less-drastic changes in flow dynamics.\n\nWhile no instances of symptomatic pulmonary embolism(PE) were reported in these investigations, symptomatic pulmonary embolism is a serious potential consequence of accidental peripheral emobolization.  As in this patient’s case, the risk of symptomatic PE is likely lower if only small volumes of the embolic agent migrate to the pulmonary vasculature.  This is a risk that may be mitigated with careful technique and intraoperative observation.\n\nReferences\nVan Rooij et al, Brain AVM Embolization with Onyx.\nAmerican Journal of Neuroradiology. 28:172-177, January 2007\n\nJahan et al, Embolization of Arteriovenous Malformations with Onyx: Clinicopathological Experience in 23 Patients.\nNeurosurgery. 48(5):984-997, May 2001", "topic_title": "Vein of Galen Malformation", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Vascular", "disease_discussion": "The vein of Galen is a short but large diameter vein that drains the paired internal cerebral veins and the two basal veins of Rosenthal into the straight sinus. It is just posterior to the pineal gland, in the quadrigeminal plate cistern. This vein probably arises from remnants of the posterior median prosencephalic vein of Markowski.\n\nBy tradition, an aneurysmal enlargement of a midline venous structure in this location has been called a \"Vein of Galen Aneurysm\". However, the true origin of this dilated vascular structure is probably persistence of the anterior portion of the median prosencephalic vein (ProsV) of Markowski.  In many patients with this malformation, there is no \"classic\" vein of Galen; and, often, there is no straight sinus.  Instead, the dilated remnant of the ProsV drains into upward directed \"falcine sinus\".\n\nThese lesions most often result from vascular shunts developing between the early choroidal arteries and the deep or midline veins, during the  6th to 11th week of gestation. At this time in development, the brain is primarily supplied by multiple choroidal arteries, then - later - the circle of Willis.\n\nThese AV shunts persist, preventing involution of the anterior prosencephalic vein.  A persistent falcine vein is often present, that drains the ProsV into the straight sinus or superior sagittal sinus.\n\nVein Of Galen Malformation Symptoms, Signs\n•  Childhood\n» High Output Failure\n» Persistent Ductus \n» Hydrocephalus\n» Cranial Bruit/Thrill\n•  Adult\n» Asymptomatic \n» Pineal Symptoms\n \n \n•  Vein Of Galen Malformation Types/Causes\n» Parenchymal AVM (Shunt)\n» Direct Fistulae To VOG\n» Dural Fistula Draining into VOG\n» Sinus Thrombosis (Intrauterine)\n» Hypoplastic Straight Sinus\n \n \n•  Hydrocephalus is very common in childhood\n» Mechanical\n  - Aqueductal Obstruction from compression of tectum\n» Impaired CSF Resorption\n  - Venous Hypertension\n \n\nUoR Teaching File - http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/smd/Rad/neurocases/Neurocase06.htm", "keywords": "pineal regionmedian prosencephalic vein of Markowskivein of Galen Aneurysm", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2347_synpic39279"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2347_synpic39275", "MPX2347_synpic39276", "MPX2347_synpic39277", "MPX2347_synpic39714", "MPX2347_synpic39715", "MPX2347_synpic39716", "MPX2347_synpic39717", "MPX2347_synpic39718", "MPX2347_synpic39719", "MPX2347_synpic39720"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2347_synpic39279", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2347_synpic39279.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "CT following embolization demonstrates Onyx material with significant beam-hardening artifact in the previous location of the malformation.

Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.

Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

Interval imaging since coiling has confirmed resolution for the past three years.", "discussion": "Saccular (berry) aneurysms are rounded outpouchings that arise from arterial bifurcation points.  They most commonly arise secondary to abnormal hemodynamic shear stresses, and are not congenital as previously believed.  Berry aneurysms can also be associated with trauma, infection, tumor, drug abuse, AVM, and AVF. \n\n15-20% of cases are multiple.  They are found in the COW / MCA bifurcation 90% of the time.  Most berry aneurysms become symptomatic between 40 and 60 years of age, commonly presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, with an associated high mortality and morbidity rate.  The risk of rupture is 1-2% annually.  There is a 20-50% rebleed risk.  Larger size correlates with increased rupture risk, but there is no critical size that can be used to predict risk for bleed.  When a berry aneurysm is discovered, aneurysm obliteration is necessary, because of the poor prognosis for subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nCT:  In the case of a patent aneurysm, a well-delineated iso/hyperdense lesion that exhibits uniform intense enhancement is demonstrated.  In the case of a thrombosed aneurysm, the residual lumen and outer rim may enhance strongly.  No enhancement is seen in complete thrombosis.\n\nMR:  Appearance can be highly variable, secondary to varied flow characteristics.  Patent aneurysms can demonstrate a hyper or hypointense signal depending on flow.  Wall enhancement may occur.  Thrombosed aneurysms demonstrate flow void signal surrounded by concentric layers of clot. \n\nReferences:\n\nCebral JR, et al.

Spread of infection is mainly hematogenous, however vertebral osteomyelitis can result from non-hematogenous sources such as direct inoculation from spinal surgery and penetrating trauma.  Blood-borne bacteria can seed the vertebral bodies via the spinal arteries. The primary venous route for extension from the pelvis to the spine is Batson’s vertebral venous plexus. This plexus contains no valves and is of variable direction, depending on the intra-abdominal pressure. Vertebral body endplates are well vascularized, and it is within the large venous sinusoids that the multidirectional blood flow allows the infection to spread throughout the vertebral bodies. Once the vertebral body endplates are infected, the pathogen can break through these endplates into the intervertebral space with resultant discitis. Most patients with vertebral osteomyelitis result from a remote site of infection, most frequently the urinary tract by hematogenous seeding.  Less commonly, affected patients have history of skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal or pelvic infections, or an episode of penetrating or non-penetrating trauma prior to the onset of vertebral osteomyelitis.  ent:", "keywords": "OsteomyelitisBack Painabscess", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2531_synpic41981", "MPX2531_synpic41983"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2531_synpic41986"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2531_synpic41981", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2531_synpic41981.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "No cord compression or focal abscess seen on CT", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "3.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2531_synpic41983", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2531_synpic41983.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "No evidence of cord compression from T10-T12", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "3.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2531_synpic41986", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2531_synpic41986.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Enhancement noted on the postgadolinium images centrally within the T10-T11 disc", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "3.2", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n52 y/o AA male recently deployed soldier who was medically evacuated due to chronic back pain that interfered with his duties as a truckdriver.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) was first described by Albright et al. in 1942.  It is a congenital hereditary abnormality that appears to be transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, basal ganglion and soft tissue calcification.\n\nIn PHP, there is a defect in the parathyroid hormone receptor-adenylate cyclase system which accounts for end organ resistance.\n\nIn most patients with classic PHP, there is a deficiency of guanyl nucleotide regulatory protein (G-unit) that normally couples receptor activity to adenylate cyclase activity.  As a result, the kidney and, less commonly, the bones are unable to respond to parathyroid hormone.  There may also be renal inability to hydroxylase 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D, the active form.\n\nPseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) was the name selected by Albright and Reifenstein to describe a syndrome in short-statured patients with rounded faces, whose roentgen features simulated exactly those of PHP, the difference being the absence of blood chemical changes.\n\nOsteosclerosis, which may be generalized or localized, is the most common skeletal abnormality of hypoparathyroidism.  Typically, radiographic findings include increased radiodensity of the skeleton, calvarial thickening and hypoplastic dentition.  Subcutaneous calcification may be seen, especially in the area of the hips and shoulders.\n\nParticularly suggestive of hypoparathyroidism are intracranial calcifications of the basal ganglia that may later coalesce into homogeneous masses.  Occasionally, these calcifications develop in the cerebellum.\n\nThe clinical syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri in association with hypoparathyroidism was reported as early as 1959 by Palmer et al.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:  Skeletal osteosclerosis is also seen in certain other disorders such as osteoblastic metastasis, myelofibrosis, Paget's disease, fluorosis, renal osteodystrophy, sickle cell anemia, and mastocytosis.  In these and other diseases, other radiographic findings are usually apparent, allowing accurate diagnosis.  In hypoparathyroidism and PHP, calvarial thickening and hypoplastic dentition are helpful clues, although Paget's disease, sickle cell anemia, and even metastasis may produce increased thickening and sclerosis of the calvarial vault.\n\nBasal ganglion calcification is particularly characteristic of hypoparathyroidism and PHP.  It is also seen without known cause in infectious disorders such as toxoplasmosis and cytomegalic inclusion disease, following radiation therapy, and following exposure to toxic substances such as carbon monoxide.\n\nSubcutaneous calcifications are also seen in collagen vascular disease, hypervitaminosis D, milk alkali syndrome, and renal osteodystrophy.  Hypoplastic dentition is also seen in cleidocranial dysostosis and pyknodysostosis, hypopituitarism, and hypothyroidism.\n\nSclerosis of the metaphyseal region of long bones seen in some patients with hypoparathyroidism is not specific.  It may be seen in children with systemic illness leading to growth arrest lines, leukemia during treatment, heavy metal poisoning, hypothyroidism, healing scurvy, and hypervitaminosis.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2305_synpic45395"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2305_synpic45393", "MPX2305_synpic45394", "MPX2305_synpic45396", "MPX2305_synpic45398"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2305_synpic45395", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2305_synpic45395.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Abnormal calcification and signal in the basal ganglia.", "age": "25", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "6.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2305_synpic45393", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2305_synpic45393.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Abnormal calcification and signal in the basal ganglia.", "age": "25", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "6.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2305_synpic45394", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2305_synpic45394.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Abnormal calcification and signal in the basal ganglia.", "age": "25", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "6.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2305_synpic45396", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2305_synpic45396.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Abnormal calcification and signal in the basal ganglia.", "age": "25", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "6.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2305_synpic45398", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2305_synpic45398.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Abnormal calcification and signal in the basal ganglia.", "age": "25", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "6.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n25 y.o. woman", "has_history": true, "has_findings": false, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": false}

They consist of large sinusoidal vascular spaces which lack normal endothelial tight juctions.  As a result, bleeding is frequent.  The majority of bleeds from these lesions, however, are subclinical with nearly 100% demonstrating hemosiderin staining of the adjacent parenchyma at diagnosis.  There is a 0.5-1% incidence of symptomatic hemmorhage/year.  The most common clinical presentation as a result of hemmorhage is the development of seizures or progressive neurologic deficits, with a seizure disorder being the presenting symptom in approximately 50% of patients with cavernous angiomas.  The degree to which a lesion is symptomatic is,like most CNS abnormalities, dependent on location. Brainstem lesions tend to present earlier with neurologic deficits.\n\nCavernous angiomas may occur anywhere within the CNS with roughly 3/4 occurring supratentorially, 1/4 within the posterior fossa and brainstem, and occasional lesions within the spinal cord.  While the occurrence may be sporadic, there is a strong familial association identified where close to 80% of members of affected families may demonstrate lesions.  In about 50% of patients the lesions will be multiple.  Whenever more than one cavernous malformation is identified in the CNS, there is probably an autosomal dominant inheritence.  This should prompt an evaluation of all first-degree relatives.\n\nImaging findings are related to the degree of prior hemmorhage of the lesions.  On CT, these lesions may be heavily calcified.  MR often demonstrates blood products of various ages centrally and a rim of hemosiderin peripherally.

The bile ducts become filled with stones (usually pigment stones), pus and sludge-like material.  The intra- and extrahepatic ducts become focally and irregularly dilated secondary to multiple strictures.  Distal obstruction is not usually present.  Biliary cirrhosis from longstanding obstruction may ultimately develop.  The disease seems to involve the left ductal system more severely.\n\nYoung adults are most commonly affected.  Clinical symptoms include fever, chills, RUQ pain and jaundice.  Septic shock and liver abscess may develop.\n\nThe etiology of this condition is debated.  Multiple pathogenic factors are proposed, including repeated infections with enteric organisms, malnutrition, parasitic infestation and portal bacteremia.  It is postulated that enteric bacteria deconjugate bilirubin and predispose to pigment calculi formation.  Parasitic infection with Clonorchis sinensis or Fasciola hepatica commonly coexist and may contribute to the pathogenesis.  However the most common organism culture from the bile in patients with RPC is E. coli\n\nThe diagnosis is often suggested on CT or US by asymmetric or patchy intrahepatic ductal dilatation and intra- and extrahepatic duct calculi.  The disease most commonly effects the lateral left lobe.  Calculi are multiple, vary in size, consistency and color and are frequently non-calcified.  Air in the bile ducts (with no previous surgery), contrast enhancement of the ductal walls, and parenchymal changes of segmental atrophy, fatty change and hepatic abscesses may also be identified on CT.  CT should be done without oral or IV contrast initially.  Intrahepatic calculi are more easily detected on non-enhanced scans, and oral contrast refluxing through an anastomosis may obscure calculi.\n\nOn sonography, the biliary sludge and amorphous intrahepatic calculi can be missed, appearing as soft tissue density without an acoustic shadow and obscuring visibility of dilated intrahepatic ducts.  Pneumobilia may be mistaken for intrahepatic calculi.  Biliary  Direct cholangiography with PTC or ERCP is used to delineate specific details but must be done carefully with prophylactic antibiotics.\n\nThere is a high recurrence rate in this disease.  Medical therapy is ineffective.  Percutaneous or endoscopic drainage, stone removal and stricture dilatation are useful in management.  Resection of the affect portion of the liver and choledocojejunostomy may be performed to improve biliary drainage and protect the unaffected portions of the liver.

Bone is a very dynamimc tissue that continuously remodels as a result of altering stresses. Repetitive stress overload results in an imbalance of bone remodeling. The abnormal level of stress results in the bone resorption exceeding the rate of bone repalcement leading to a weakening of the bone.  There is a continuum of injury beginning with weakening of the bone, fatigue, stress fracture and finally, complete fracture of the involved bone.\n\nStress injuries of bones are very common among athletes and can occur in nearly any bone, however, the vast majority of stress injuries occur in the bones of the lower extremity. Tarsal navicular stress fractures typically occur in elite athletes, including runners, basketball players, gymnasts, and football players. Those athletes that play on artificial turf seem to be at an increased risk for stress fractures of the tarsal navicular bone.\n\nThe diagnosis of tarsal navicular stress fracture is often delayed many weeks to months because the onset of symptoms are insidious and in addition, the diagnosis is often difficult to make on conventional radiographs. Patients usually present with pain along the dorsal aspect of the foot which is made worse by running or jumping. Tarsal navicular stress fractures are usually treated with casting and athletes typically return to full activity within 5 to 6 months. If a complete fracture occurs, the individual may require internal fixation, which can delay return to normal activity.\n\nMost tarsal navicular stress fractures occur in the middle third of the navicular bone, which is a relatively avascular portion of the bone. The fracture may be complete or incomplete, however the incomplete fractures tend to begin along the dorsal aspect of the bone adjacent to the talonavicular joint. Foot anomalies can be associated with stress fractures of the tarsal navicular. This injury is most often seen in individuals that have a short first metatarsal or long second metatarsal. This is thought to result in increased shear forces being transmitted along the second metatarsal through the middle cunieform and into the middle third of the navicular bone.\n\nEvaluation of a suspected stress injury of the tarsal navicular should begin with radiographs of the foot, however this area of the navicular is difficult to visualize on radiographs and MR or CT is often required to correctly establish the diagnosis.", "keywords": "stress fracturetarsal navicularfoot", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1118_synpic17090"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1118_synpic17088", "MPX1118_synpic17089"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1118_synpic17090", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1118_synpic17090.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A lucnet line which represents the stress fracture extends through the middle third of the tarsal navicular bone.

HSV-1 accounts for 95% of all herpetic encephalitis, and is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. \n\nThe presenting symptoms are multiple and often originate with fever, headache, seizures, confusion, stupor, and coma.  Patients may also demonstrate the gradual onset of olfactory hallucinations, anosmia, personality change, psychotic behavior, delirium, aphasia, and hemiparesis.   These symptoms are directly related to the involvement of the temporal lobes, insular cortex, and orbital surface of the frontal lobes by this disease.\n\nAfter initial contact through infected secretions in the oronasopharnyx, HSV-1 travels via the lingual portion of the trigeminal nerve, to the gasserian ganglia where the virus remains dormant.  Upon reactivation from the influences of local trauma, immunosuppression, or stress, or the result of primary infection, the virus spreads in a retrograde fashion along the fibers that innervate the leptomeninges of the anterior and middle fossa.\n\nEarly diagnosis and rapid therapy is essential, as herpes encephalitis progresses rapidly.  The mortality rate ranges from 50% to 70%, with those surviving left with significant neurological impairment to include amnesia, dementia, seizures, and aphasia.  Both the patient’s age and level of consciousness at the time of initiation of intravenous acyclovir dictate outcomes.  If the patient is unconscious prior to beginning therapy, the outcome is poor.  If the patient is awake, and treatment is begun within 4 days of onset of the illness, survival is greater than 90 percent. \n\nLaboratory:\n\nCSF demonstrates increased pressure and a pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance.  \nRed cells, and xanthochromia are identified in a minority of cases, secondary to hemorrhage.  Protein content is increased, and CSF glucose may rarely be lower than 40 mg/dL.\n\nPolymerase Chain Reaction may be employed to identify HSV antigen in the CSF while the virus is replicating in the first few days of the illness.\n\nPathology:\n\nGross Pathologic Features: \n\nHemorrhagic and necrotizing encephalitis of gray and white matter, with severe edema and tissue necrosis localized to the inferior frontal, temporal lobes, and insular cortex.  \n\nMicroscopically:\n\nFocal necrotizing vasculitis with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, with eosinophilic Cowdry intranuclear inclusion bodies located in neurons, and glial cells.\n\nHerpes viruses include HSV-1, HSV-2, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, B virus, HSV-6, and HSV-7.\n\n\nRadiology:\n\nThe imaging findings of HSV encephalitis on CT may be initially normal or subtly abnormal.  Generally, abnormalities are not identified until 3-5 days after the onset of significant symptoms.  Common initial findings are low attenuation in the medial temporal lobes and insula, with mild mass effect.  Hemorrhage may occasionally be identified and is a late finding that is highly suggestive of herpes encephalitis.  On contrast enhanced CT, there is ill-defined patchy enhancement, with gyriform enhancement being a late finding.  \n\nMRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting early changes, and demonstrates signal changes in almost all sequences.  T1 weighted images demonstrate areas of low signal intensity with surrounding edema localized to the temporal lobes, insular cortex, subfrontal area, and cingulate gyri.  Loss of the gray-white matter differentiation, and evidence of mass effect is frequently encountered.  Additionally, in cases of hemorrhage, there may be foci of increased signal in the inferior parts of the frontal and temporal lobes.  T2 weighted images demonstrate asymmetric bilateral high signal intensity in gray, and subcortical white matter of the temporal lobes, extending into the insular cortex, secondary to edema.  The basal ganglia are usually spared.  Findings are initially unilateral, followed by less severe contralateral temporal lobe signal abnormalities.\n\nProton density sequences demonstrate increased signal intensity in affected areas.  T2 weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences demonstrate hyperintense signal with edematous cortex and subcortical white matter.  T2 gradient recalled echo sequences show hypointensity if there is hemorrhage within the edematous brain parenchyma.  \n\nDiffusion weighted images demonstrate marked hyperintense restricted diffusion, and reduced ADC values.  It is important to distinguish these findings from ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, abscess, lymphoma, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, glioma, and metastatic disease, for the determination of appropriate treatment.  HSV encephalitis can be differentiated from other high signal intensity DW MR images, and low ADC values based on the clinical presentation of the patient, distribution of the imaging findings, and results of the polymerase chain reaction test.\n\nT1 weighted gadolinium enhanced images demonstrate asymmetric mild patchy enhancement indicating abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier.  Gyriform enhancement may be seen one week after initial symptoms.  Meningeal enhancement is an early finding, with parenchymal enhancement being a late finding, or evidence of hemorrhage.\n\nMR spectroscopy may be utilized demonstrating elevated peaks of lactate, choline, and myoinositol, and reduced N-acetylaspartate signal. \n\nFollow-up imaging demonstrates progressive abnormalities with worsening involvement of the contralateral temporal lobe, insula, and cingulate gyri.

The dissection can result with stenosis, occlusion, aneurysmal dilation, intraluminal thrombus formation, or extravascular hemorrhage.\n\nRadiographic evaluation for vertebral artery dissection can be complicated by false negatives and false positives. The most common radiographic techniques used for evaluation include CT and MR. Common causes of false positives include turbulent flow simulating stenosis or adjacent structures that mimic hematoma, or patient body habitus. False negatives are often related to lack of inclusion of the affected area in the study field. Often times, evaluation of headache which may be secondary to dissection results in imaging of the head without inclusion of the neck, although the majority of vertebral dissections occur in the cervical neck. \n\nTreatment for vertebral artery dissection often involves antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy.

Chorea-ballismus with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus.\nAJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 1996 Jun-Jul;17(6):1057-64.\n\nAbstract\nPURPOSE: To describe the neuroimaging (Ct, MR, and single-photon emission CT [SPECT]) findings in a series of patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus and to correlate the imaging findings with the clinical presentation.\n\nMETHODS: The neuroimaging and clinical data from 10 patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus were evaluated. Family and drug histories, as well as other causes of chorea, were excluded. All 10 patients had CT, 5 also had MR imaging, and 3 had SPECT examinations. Three had follow-up CT and MR imaging studies, and MR findings were correlated with CT findings in 5 cases. Two experienced neuroradiologists, aware of the diagnosis but blinded to the clinical status of the patients, evaluated all images and reached a consensus as to the final\ninterpretation.\n\nRESULTS: CT studies in 9 of 10 patients showed a hyperdense putamen and/or caudate nucleus; in 1, the CT findings were normal. T1-weighted MR images in all 5 patients who had MR imaging (including the patient with a normal CT study) showed hyperintense lesions without significant T2 signal alternation at the basal ganglia. In all 3 of the patients who had SPECT studies of the brain, the scans revealed hypoperfusion at corresponding areas. All 3 follow-up studies depicted resolution of the lesions in the abnormal basal ganglia. Increased hypointensity on T2-weighted and gradient-echo T2*-weighted images was also\nobserved in the sequential MR images. In all patients, the initial side of involvement correlated well with the neuroimaging findings. The chorea resolved within 2 days after treatment of the hyperglycemia in 9 patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: In patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus, CT and T1-weighted MR images show unilateral or bilateral lesions of the putamen and/or caudate. SPECT scans show hypoperfusion. These findings may be related to petechial hemorrhage and/or myelin destruction. Early recognition of these imaging characteristics may facilitate diagnosis of primary diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia and prompt appropriate therapy.\n\nPMID: 8791916", "keywords": "diabetes basal ganglia (putamen)hemiballismus hemichoreaCT hyperdense, T1W hyperintense T2W hypointense", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1956_synpic54992", "MPX1956_synpic54993", "MPX1956_synpic54994", "MPX1956_synpic54995"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1956_synpic54997", "MPX1956_synpic54998", "MPX1956_synpic54999", "MPX1956_synpic55000", "MPX1956_synpic55001", "MPX1956_synpic55003", "MPX1956_synpic55004", "MPX1956_synpic55005"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1956_synpic54992", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1956_synpic54992.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Abnormal hyperattenuation in the right basal ganglia.

Imaging findings of hemangioblastoma however, may range from primarily cystic to mostly solid.", "topic_title": "Cerebellar hemangioblastoma", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Neoplasm, non-glial", "disease_discussion": "Cerebellar  hemangioblastomas  are benign neoplasms of vascular origin.    They are not malformations.  They account for less than 3% of all intracranial neoplasms (1).  These tumors are most common  in  young  and middle-aged  adults,  where the incidence in males exceeds that of females (2).  The cerebellar hemisphere is the most common location, although they may be located in  the  spinal  cord,  brain stem,  or cerebral  hemispheres.    Ten percent of hemangioblastomas occur as part of the von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n\nSixty percent of these tumors are cystic, as in this case.  The enhancing mural nodule is a common finding in hemangioblastoma.  At CT,  the  cystic  portion of the tumor appears low density and does not enhance, while the  mural  nodule  enhances  homogeneously  and intensely.  The  MR  findings,  as  seen  in this case, include a predominantly cystic tumor with long  T1  and  long  T2  relaxation times,  and  intense enhancement of the peripheral nodule following gadolinium administration.  If the vascular nodule has bled  or  is proteinaceous,  it  may  be  hyperintense  on  short TR precontrast sequences.  More than one  enhancing  tumor  nodule  may  be  seen. Forty  percent  of hemangioblastomas are solid and display variable degrees of contrast enhancement.\n\nLateral  projections of a left vertebral artery subtraction angiogram (arterial and venous phases) in another patient with hemangioblastoma are shown in Films .6 and .7.  The angiographic findings are characteristic for a hemangioblastoma.  Notice the focal  enhancing nodule  fed  predominantly  by  the  superior cerebellar artery and seen densely enhancing in the arterial phase.   Because of  significant  artifact  in  the  posterior  fossa on CT, a small peripheral nodule may be missed and angiography is felt to be more sensitive  than  contrast  CT scan for detecting nodules.  MRI with Gd-DTPA may replace angiography for  evaluation  of  patients  with suspected hemangioblastoma.\n\nvon  Hippel-Lindau  disease  is  an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete and variable penetrance (3).  The incidence is equal in males and females.  Multiple lesions have been reported in  this syndrome,  but  the  most important lesions which cause significant morbidity include retinal angiomatosis, cerebellar or  spinal  cord hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.  Over  50% of patients with this syndrome have hemangioblastomas of the retina, which may present with acute or  chronic  retinal  detachment.  Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals these lesions, and radiographic evaluation plays a small role.\n\nThirty-six  to sixty percent of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have cerebellar hemangioblastoma.  Signs and symptoms due  to  this tumor  are  the  most common cause for patients to present with the syndrome.\n\nAlthough  the reported occurrence of spinal cord hemangioblastoma is 5%, autopsy data  and  MRI  suggest  the  incidence  may  be higher (4,5).    Signs and symptoms of a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may be dramatic, and neurologic deficit from a spinal  cord  lesion may  be overlooked.  Typical MR findings in a spinal cord hemangioblastoma include syringomyelia,  enhancing  nodule,  and  enlarged feeding and draining vessels.  \n\nTwenty-five  to  thirty-eight  percent  of  patients  with  von Hippel-Lindau disease will develop renal cell carcinoma, which may be multiple  and bilateral.   Pheochromocytoma is found in 10% of patients with this disease.\n\nOther  lesions  in  von  Hippel-Lindau  disease include angiomas of the liver and kidney and cysts of  the  pancreas,  liver,  kidney  and epididymis.  \n\nRoutine  screening  of  family  members  of  a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease has been  recommended.    MRI  with  Gd-DTPA  is  the procedure of choice to screen for CNS involvement.\n\nIn  the  adult, the  differential diagnosis for a cystic mass in the posterior fossa includes a simple arachnoid cyst or  a  cerebellar astrocytoma.    A  simple  arachnoid  cyst  is extra- axial and will not demonstrate an enhancing  nodule,  although  such  a  nodule  may  be  seen  in  a cerebellar  astrocytoma.  Since 40% of cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be solid, this lesion should be included in the differential of a solid or partially solid mass  in  the  posterior  fossa  in  the adult.  These lesions   are   uncommon   in   children, and medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or astrocytoma are more likely than a cerebellar hemangioblastoma when a posterior fossa mass is seen in a child.", "keywords": "hemangioblastoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2425_synpic50903", "MPX2425_synpic50904", "MPX2425_synpic50905"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2425_synpic50895", "MPX2425_synpic50896", "MPX2425_synpic50897", "MPX2425_synpic50898", "MPX2425_synpic50899", "MPX2425_synpic50900", "MPX2425_synpic50901", "MPX2425_synpic50902"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2425_synpic50903", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2425_synpic50903.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT -

However, as the patients symptoms continued, and clinical concern for reoccurence mounted, further MR imaging with the use of 3D Fast Imaging Employing STeady-state Acquisition (FIESTA) clearly demonstrates the epidermoid tumor, which may have been present all along.", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Epidermoid Tumor", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "Lesions/Condition: Epidermoid Tumor\n\nDiscussion:\n\nEpidermoid tumors typically occur between the ages of 20 and 60, with the peak incidence in the fourth decade, affecting both men and women equally.\n\nIntracranial epidermoid tumors are congenital inclusion cysts that comprise 1% of primary intracranial neoplasms.  They are thought to arise from the enclosure of ectodermal elements when the neural tube closes at 3-5 weeks gestation.  Additionally, acquired epidermoid tumors may occur as the result of trauma, although this is relatively uncommon in the brain.  Epidermoids are composed of an outer capsule of connective tissue that surrounds a layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and inner cystic fluid that includes debris, keratin, water, and cholesterol.  As the epithelial layer desquamates, the cells accumulate and form a cholesterol-rich layer that gives the tumor its characteristic pearly white appearance.  Epidermoids subtly grow within the CSF spaces, surrounding and encasing adjacent neurovascular structures.  The tumor has an irregular and lobulated cauliflower-like outer surface that shines like a “mother of pearl.”\n\nThe majority of intracranial epidermoid tumors are intradural lesions, in the basal subarachnoid spaces occurring off-midline.  Between 40%-50% of cases are found in the cerebellopontine angle cistern.  After schwannoma and meningioma, epidermoid tumors are the third most common cerebellopontine angle mass.  Epidermoid tumors also occur in the sellar and parasellar regions.  Less commonly, epidermoid tumors have been reported in the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and rarely in the lateral ventricles.  Approximately ten percent of epidermoid tumors are extradural, occurring in the skull or spine.\n\nEpidermoid tumors are benign slow-growing tumors, and malignant degeneration is extremely rare.  \n\nClinical Features:\n\nClinical features of epidermoid tumors are usually secondary to the mass effect of the tumor on adjacent structures.  Gait disturbance, cranial neuropathies, and occasionally seizures are presenting symptoms.  Hydrocephalus is not commonly seen with intracranial epidermoid tumors.   Additionally, symptoms related to chemical meningitis caused by leakage of tumor contents into the subarachnoid space may be seen.\n\nRadiology:\n\nEpidermoid tumors on CT are well-circumscribed, homogenous lobulated extra-axial masses, that are nonenhancing, and hypoattenuating, and are similar to CSF, secondary to the presence of solid cholesterol and/or loculated CSF within the tumor, and rarely demonstrate calcification.\n\nMR imaging is the best modality for evaluating these tumors.  Typically, epidermoid tumors demonstrate a lamellated appearance on MR imaging, secondary to the desquamated squamous epithelium.  Most epidermoid tumors have signal intensities that are near CSF signal, low to intermediate on T1 weighted images, and slightly hyperintense on T2 weighted images.  The main differential diagnostic consideration is that of an arachnoid cyst, with arachnoid cyst following the signal intensity patterns of CSF with all MR pulse sequences, whereas epidermoid tumors are not hypointense on FLAIR images and demonstrate areas of hyperintense signal relative to CSF.  Furthermore, on DW images, epidermoid tumors demonstrate restricted diffusion, which is not characteristic of arachnoid cysts.  Additionally, approximately 25% of epidermoid tumors will demonstrate a thin rim of peripheral enhancement following the administration of contrast material.  Furthermore, employing the use of a high resolution gradient-echo T2 sequence, such as 3D Fast Imaging Employing STeady-state Acquisition (FIESTA) the lamellated epidermoid tumor is clearly depicted as low signal intensity as it is contrasted against a hyperintense CSF background, achieving a precise preoperative assessment of surgical anatomy.\n\nFinally, the signal characteristics of epidermoid tumors vary depending on its composition.  Rarely, epidermoids will appear hyperattenuated on CT, secondary to elevated protein content, with reversal of signal characteristics on MR imaging, high signal intensity on T1WI, and low signal intensity on T2WI.  \n\nTreatment:  \n\nSubtotal resection is usually performed to alleviate compression of adjacent structures, and to avoid damaging vital structures.

Ultrasound has recently received considerable attention as a means of diagnosing appendicitis.  In skilled hands, it has a sensitivity over 90% and an even higher specificity.  The examination is performed by gradually pressing the transducer down on the skin of the right lower quadrant, thereby displacing gas filled bowel loops and minimizing the distance between the transducer and the appendix.  The diagnosis is made when the diseased appendix is identified as a tubular, noncompressible structure measuring 6mm or more in diameter and demonstrating no peristalsis.  Confidence is further increased when a appendicolith, an echogenic focus with posterior shadowing seen in approximately one-third of patients, is identified.

The incidence of incidentalomas has been estimated to be as high as 1.4% to 10% based on autopsies, but in actual practice occur at a frequency of .35% to 5%.         \n\n       Amongst the various imaging modalities available to the clinical/surgical team, CT is the most useful for evaluating adrenal masses.  Utilizing 5 mm collimations, tumors as small as 10 mm may be detected.  Although not accepted in clinical practice, multiple studies indicate that low HU masses are more likely to be benign than malignant.   One series indicates that masses less than 18 HU are benign (85% sensitivity, 100% specificity).  Another set of studies states that those less than 10 HU are benign (73% sensitivity, 96% specificity).   Another factor to consider in evaluation for malignancy is the size of the lesion.  The greater the size of the lesion, the greater the likelihood of adrenal carcinoma versus adenoma.  Lesions less than 3 cm on CT are unlikely to be malignant, whereas lesions greater than 6 cm are usually carcinomas.  In addition metastases tend to be less then 4 cm in size.\n      Plain films, ultrasound, and tomograms are not as sensitive, whereas angiography, and scintigraphy are too invasive.  MRI is indicated if malignancy or a pheochromocytoma is suspected.   On T1 or T2 weighted MRI, a benign adrenal adenoma will have the same signal intensity as the surrounding adrenal tissue.  On the other hand, a pheochromocytoma will have a very high signal intensity relative to the surrounding tissue on T2 weighted MRI.  An adrenal carcinoma will be hyperintense relative to the liver, but less so than a pheochromocytoma; and metastatic lesions will similarly have a high signal intensity but not as high as a pheochromocytoma.  Dynamic gadolinium enhanced MRI has been demonstrated to have over 90% specificity and sensitivity in differentiating benign from malignant adrenal masses.\n       Fine needle aspiration is very fine for differentiating metastatic versus primary adrenal tumor with 80-100% sensitivity.  However, it is not quite as good at differentiating benign versus malignant primary tumors (54-86% sensitivity).   However, this is countered by the fact that primary adrenal tumors are usually greater than 6 cm, whereas metastatases are usually less than 4 cm.\n       Other imaging modalities include nuclear scintigraphy with cholesterol radiotracers (I 19-iodocholesterol and selenomethylnorcholesterol [scintiadren]).  Non hypersecrecting adenomas and tumors secreting cortisol, aldosterone and androgen demonstrate increased uptake. \n      One other powerful and exciting imaging modality is positron emission tomography scanning, particularly when fused with CT scans.  PET has proven to be 100% sensitive and specific in differentiating benign and metastatic lesions.  18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging and 131-I MIBG imaging have been used for pheochromocytomas.  111-In octreotide imaging is also used.\n       85-90% of pheochromocytomas originate from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.   The other 10% are extramedullary in origin and more properly termed paragangliomas.  The vast majority are benign with just 10% of them being malignant.   While we are tossing tens around, 10% of pheochromocytomas are found in childhood, 10% are familial, meaning that they are found in certain syndromes.\n      Pheochromocytomas cause paroxysmal or persistent hypertension due to excess epinephrine/normetanephrine production.   However, only .1-.3% of hypertensive patients have this as cause of hypertension.  Less than half of the patients with pheochromocytoma present with paroxysmal hypertension.  The majority have chronic hypertension, or chronic hypertension with overlying lability.  Paroxysms can be triggered by stress, exercise, posture change, palpation, smoking, and even urination.  Other symptoms include tachycardia, palpitations, headache, sweating, tremor, anxiety and a sense of impending doom. Less frequent symptoms include abdominal or chest pain, nausea and vomiting.  Hypertension can lead to CHF, pulmonary edema, MI, ventricular fibrillation and CVAs.  Catecholamine cardiomyopathy describes the damage to the heart due to pheochromocytoma:   the process of cardiac  ischemic damage secondary to catecholamine induced vasomotor constriction of myocardial circulation or direct toxicity from catecholamines.\n    Occasionally, pheochromocytomas elaborate other steroids or peptides, leading to syndromes such as Cushing’s.  Classically, however, catecholamine secreting pheochromocytoma is diagnosed by increased urinary excretion of catecholamines, their metabolites (VMA), and metanephrines, and the imaging modalities described above.  Certain medications may confound diagnosis by falsely elevating catecholamines.  These include TCAs, BZDs, amphetamines; labetalol, L-dopa, methyldopa, clonidine, and alcohol.\n      Pheochromocytomas occasionally (10%) occur in familial, mainly autosomal dominant syndrome including : MEN II a or II b, tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel-Lindau, von Recklinghausen and Sturge-Weber syndrome.  Familial forms occur mainly in childhood with a male preponderance.  Non-familial forms typically occur between 40-60 years of age with a slight female preponderance.\n      After diagnosis, pheochromocytomas must be localized with the use of CT, MRI, MIBG, and PET scans.  98% are found in the abdominal cavity, but pheochromocytomas can be found anywhere from the base of the skull to the pelvis, in a para-aortic or para-vertebral location.  Occult pheochromocytomas are classically found in the bladder, or in the organ of Zuckerkandl (which is located superior to the branching of the inferior mesenteric artery, anterior to the aorta).\n      Pheochromocytomas must be removed surgically.  It is absolutely essential to modulate catecholamine release pre-operatively by administering alpha blockers (usu phenoxybenzamine 40-160 mg QD divided) in sufficient dose to cause nasal stuffiness or borderline hypotension. Beta blockade with propanolol to control excess beta stimulation (tachycardia/cardiac arrhythmia) is doen AFTER alpha blockade.  Otherwise peripheral perfusion may be compromised.  Volume replace for adequate circulating volume if necessary.  Utilize a midline or transverse incision to explore the adrenals bilaterally and explore the paraaortic and paracaval retroperitoneum from diaphragm to pelvis.  Laparoscopic adrenalectomy utilizing a flank, retroperitoneal or transabdominal approach is a newer technique which offers lower morbidity, and decreased hospital stay.  However, the surgeon must be sure to localize all tumors in advance via imaging studies.", "keywords": "pheochromocytoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1683_synpic16676", "MPX1683_synpic16677", "MPX1683_synpic16678"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1683_synpic16676", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1683_synpic16676.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Abdomen", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Abdominal CT demonstrates a mass adjacent to the left kidney with distinct borders.

Brain death was declared, and after discussion with her family, advanced life support was terminated.", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Nontraumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "acr_code": "1.7", "category": "Hemorrhage", "disease_discussion": "The classic presentation of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is the acute onset of a severe headache which reaches its maximum intensity within minutes, often referred to as the “thunder clap” headache. Many patients describe this as \"the worst headache of my life\".  There may be associated neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and possibly obtundation or coma.\n\nPhysical examination may show retinal hemorrhages, nuchal rigidity, or focal neurological signs. An altered level of consciousness is seen in approximately one third of patients while meningeal irritation signs are seen in up to 85% of patients and virtually all have nausea.   Kernig sign is pain elicited by straightening the knee with the thigh flexed at the hip.  Brudzinski sign is pain and/or ridgidity with simultaneous neck and knee/hip flexion.   \n\nThe differential diagnosis of a thunder clap headache includes aneurysm thrombosis without rupture, “leakage” into an aneurysm wall, aneurysm rupture with subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral vein/dural venous sinus thrombosis, localized meningeal inflammation, nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, first or worst migraine headache attack, benign exertional headache, and benign thunderclap headache [no associated subarachnoid hemorrhage]. Since early recognition and surgery may benefit patients with aneurysm rupture, all patients with thunderclap headache require evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage. In North America, 75% to 90% of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is caused by aneurysm rupture.  \n\nThe primary diagnostic modalities in the evaluation of subarachnoid hemorrhage include noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan and, if negative, a lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spectrophotometry. The probability of detecting subarachnoid hemorrhage of CT scans performed at various intervals after the ictus is: day 0, 95%; day 3, 74%; day 7, 50%; day 14, 30%; and day 21, almost zero.  It is important to note that the sensitivity of CT in detecting subarachnoid hemorrhage decreases with time, and may miss up to 5% of cases even in the first 12 hours after symptom onset.\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging is not as sensitive in the detection of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and does not usually play a role in the initial diagnostic evaluation.  MR findings include alteration of CSF (reduced diffusion and bright CSF on DWI, bright on FLAIR). CT has greater availability, lower expense, and faster scanning times. \n\nAcute subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as high attenuation on noncontrast CT within the subarachnoid spaces.  Blood will insinuate within the sulci over the cerebral convexities as it mixes with CSF. A focal cisternal or parenchymal hemorrhage may suggest the location of a ruptured aneurysm - although this localization is often postural. Focal anterior interhemispheric blood may be due to an anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture. Blood in the sylvian fissure may be due to a middle cerebral artery, internal carotid artery terminus, or posterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture. Posterior communicating artery aneurysms may be associated with third cranial nerve palsies and often bleed into the temporal lobe. Posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms often bleed into the fourth ventricle.\n\nNonthrombosed aneurysms may be seen as a well delineated, isodense to slightly hyperdense mass located somewhat eccentrically in the suprasellar cistern or sylvian fissure. \n\nAfter detection of subarachnoid hemorrhage by either CT or lumbar puncture the evaluation can proceed directly to a four vessel catheter angiogram.  At some institutions, however, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the head is the preferred next step.   Several studies have shown that CTA is excellent at detecting aneurysms larger than 3 mm. When a CTA adequately demonstrates an aneurysm, patients can proceed to definitive treatment without a catheter angiogram.  In some institutions, catheter angiograms are preferred to CTA, and are always the next step for patients in whom no aneurysm is detected on CTA or in patients with aneurysms amenable to endovascular intervention by coils or balloon occlusion.\n\nApproximately 90% of all intracranial aneurysms arise from the anterior (carotid) cerebral circulation while 10% arise from the posterior (vertebrobasilar) circulation. The most common locations are the anterior communicating artery (35%), posterior communicating artery origin (30%), middle cerebral artery bifurcation or trifurcation (25%), basilar artery tip (5%), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and other sites distal to the circle of Willis (5%). Up to 30% of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have multiple intracranial aneurysms, that may present in \"mirror image\" locations. Patent aneurysms are seen as a contrast filled outpouching from the vessel wall on angiography. Ruptured aneurysms typically have an irregular or lobulated appearance.  Localized vasospasm and subarachnoid hemorrhage are also helpful signs of aneurysm rupture, particularly in those patients with multiple aneurysms.\n\nRisk factors for development of intracranial aneurysms include numerous connective tissue disorders and account for approximately 5% of cases.  Associated conditions include:  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, hypertension, aortic coarctation, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Other etiologies include drug abuse (cocaine), infection (mycotic aneurysms), neoplasm, or trauma. \n\nIn approximately 15-30% of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, no aneurysm is found despite a complete four vessel cerebral angiogram. These patients fall into two distinct subsets: a nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage pattern and an “aneurysmal” pattern. In the first (perimesencephalic) subset, the hemorrhage is typically anterior to the brainstem and within the interpeduncular fossa or ambient cisterns and is thought to result from rupture of small pontine or perimesencephalic veins.\n\nIn the second subset of patients, subarachnoid hemorrhage fills the suprasellar cistern and extends into the sylvian or anterior interhemispheric fissures. Patients with an aneurysmal pattern of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage are at risk for rebleeding, cerebral ischemia, and neurological deficit Repeat four-vessel cerebral angiography demonstrates an aneurysm in 5% to 10% of these cases. Non-identification of the aneurysm on the first angiogram may be secondary to local vasospasm with incomplete filling of the aneurysm. \n\nAcute subarachnoid hemorrhage carries a mortality rate of 25% in the first 24 hours and 50% within three months. Causes of sudden death include a large intraparenchymal hematoma, destruction of brain tissue, acute hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory failure. Of the patients that reach a major medical center the leading causes of death are the sequelae of the initial hemorrhage, recurrent aneurysmal rupture and vasospasm with ischemic stroke. While the potential complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage are extensive, the primary goal of medical management is to address the leading causes of death by trying to prevent vasospasm and recurrent hemorrhage. \n\nVasospasm typically occurs seven days (5-10 days) after the subarachnoid hemorrhage, and is prevented predominantly via administration of a calcium channel blocker such as nimodipine, which decreases blood pressure but increases cerebral blood flow. Maintaining adequate hydration is also important. Transcranial Doppler evaluation is helpful in monitoring for the development of vasospasm by detecting elevated intracranial arterial velocities. This is seen most frequently in the distal internal carotid artery and the proximal portions of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, regardless of the location of the aneurysm rupture.  Once vasospasm occurs, medical therapy is aimed at increasing cerebral blood flow, predominantly with volume expansion and drug-induced hypertension. Transluminal angioplasty is extremely successful in dilating vasospastic arteries.\n\nThe prevention of recurrent hemorrhage, which is highest immediately after the initial subarachnoid hemorrhage, is through early surgical or endovascular treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Endovascular therapy with platinum coils was introduced in 1990 as an alternative to surgical clipping. The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) demonstrated a significant risk reduction with endovascular therapy over surgery for ruptured aneurysms amenable to either therapy. Endovascular treatment is particularly useful in posterior circulation aneurysms, such as a basilar tip aneurysm, in which the surgical approach is extremely difficult.  With the exception of difficult access to posterior circulation aneurysms, surgical clipping is an effective and definitive treatment modality of ruptured aneurysms. Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage should be evaluated in treatment centers that offer both neurosurgery and neuroendovascular treatment, allowing the neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists to assess the advantages and disadvantages of clipping or coiling for each individual patient.\n\nIn summary, nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most common secondary cause of the worst headache of life and 75% to 90% of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is caused by aneurysm rupture. Since early diagnosis and treatment of aneurysm rupture may improve the patient’s outcome, all patients presenting with the worst headache of life require evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage with a noncontrast CT scan and a lumbar puncture if the CT scan is negative. Once subarachnoid hemorrhage is detected, either a CT angiogram or a catheter angiogram should be performed, preferably at a facility with both interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons. This allows the patient to undergo aneurysm coiling or clipping and be appropriately managed for common complications such as vasospasm or recurrent hemorrhage.", "keywords": "subarachnoid hemorrhageaneurysmthunderclap", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1397_synpic31411"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1397_synpic31411", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1397_synpic31411.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Dense subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar and basilar cisterns, as well as along the tentorium.

Occlusion is usually caused by lateral retraction of the uncinate process with apposition of the uncinate process against the inferomedial aspect of the orbital wall. There is resultant enlargement of the adjacent middle meatus with associated lateral retraction of the middle turbinate.

Initially described as a layered pearly tumor of fat containing biliary fat or cholestrin interspersed among sheets of polyhedral cells.  Cholesteatomas actually do not contain fat but are composed of an outer matrix which surrounds layers of desquamated epithelium. The matrix is comprised of differentiated keratinized squamous epithelium in a collagen matrix.\nIncidence:  The incidence of cholesteatomas is unknown, but it is a relatively common reason for otologic surgery. Death from intracranial complications of a cholesteatoma is uncommon, due to early recognition, timely surgical intervention, and supportive antibiotic therapy. Cholesteatomas remain a relatively common cause of permanent, moderate conductive hearing loss in children and adults. \nTypes:  Cholesteatoma may be classified according to presumed etiology into two general categories: congenital and acquired.  Acquired cholesteatomas can be further divided into primary and secondary acquired.  \nCongenital: (2%)  Congenital cholesteatomas are believed to arise from embryonal inclusions or rests of epithelial cells in the middle ear, mastoid, or petrous bone.  Applies only to cholesteatomas in patients with the following criteria: an intact tympanic membrane, no continuity with the external ear canal,  and lack of etiological factor, i.e.  tympanic membrane perforation, history of ear infections or Eustachian tube dysfunction.\nAcquired: 98%\n1.\tPrimary Acquired: most common type; arises from retraction of the superior pars flaccida (Prussak's space) of the tympanic membrane which results in the formation of an epithelial pocket.  \n2.\tSecondary Acquired:  due to chronic infection and perforation of the pars tensa which results in trapping of epithelial cells within the middle ear.  \n\nPathogenesis:  Several pathogenic mechanisms have been produced to explain the development of acquired cholesteatomas,  however, in all types the keratinizing squamous epithelium has spread beyond its normal location.\n\tThe pathogenesis of primary cholesteatoma is poorly understood.  \tIt is believed that infection/inflammation, TM or Eustachian tube dysfunction, leads to retraction of the tympanic membrane, usually in the region of the superior pars flaccida in Prussak's space.  This retraction results in an epithelial-lined pocket that becomes sealed and subsequently expands b/c of progressive accumulation of epithelial debris, extending posteriorly through the aditus and antrum to the mastoid air cells.  Extension also occurs along the posterior tympanic recesses and petrous apex.\n\tSecondary acquired cholesteatoma is believed to occur via implantation of squamous epithelium into the middle ear as a result of TM perforation (iatrogenic vs traumatic).  Another mechanism is via metaplasia of the cuboidal epithelium of the middle ear to keratinized stratified squamous epithelium due to chronic or recurrent otitis media.  \n\nPathophysiology:\n\tCholesteatomas enlarge with fairly typical patterns of growth.  The most common locations from which cholesteatoma arise are the posterior epitympanum, the posterior mesotympanum and the anterior epitympanum.  Cholesteatomas are channeled along characteristic pathways by surrounding mucosal folds, the middle ear ossicles, and their suspensory ligaments.    \n\tCholesteatomas may grow and cause  primarily bony erosion of the following:\n\t\tScutum\n\t\tOssicles\n\t\tMastoid air cells\n\t\tTegmen\n\t\tSigmoid sinus plate\n\t\tFacial nerve canal\n\t\tLateral semicircular canal wall\n\n\tExtensive disease may result in:  meningitis, abscess, venous sinus thrombosis, CSF rhinorrhea, labrynthine fistula.\n\tCholesteatoma in children is considered to be more aggressive than in the adult population.  Extensive disease is found more frequently in children compared to adults. Also, higher rates of residual and recurrent disease have been documented in the pediatric population.  However, the incidence of complications is directly related to the duration of disease, which is longer in adult patients.  Therefore, complication rates are higher in adults. \n Clinical Manifestations:  Most cholesteatomas are asymptomatic in their early development; children may come to medical attention with otorrhea and rarely complain of decreased hearing.  The most common presenting symptoms are hearing loss, otorrhea, otalgia, nasal obstruction, tinnitus and vertigo.  A previous history of middle ear disease, such as chronic otitis media and/or tympanic membrane perforation may be evident.  Progressive unilateral hearing loss with a chronic foul smelling otorrhea should  raise suspicion.\nPhysical exam: white mass behind the posterior half of the tympanic membrane, A retraction pocket may be seen, often in the attic or posterosuperior quadrant of the TM. facial nerve palsy, vertigo When extensive, a polyp may protrude through an attic defect.\n\nRadiologic Findings: Classic finding on CT is a soft tissue density in Prussak's space (superior recess of the TM) with subtle erosion of the scutum and neck of malleus and medial displacement of the remaining ossicles.\n\nCT: nondependent homogenous mass with well-or ill-defined borders; TM bulging with displacement of ossicles, +/- erosion of the scutum and ossicles; expansion of the attic.

Simple parapneumonic effusions are uninfected, free-flowing fluid collections. Complicated parapneumonic effusions are early infected fluid collections prone to develop loculations by fibrinous septations. Empyema is a collection of frank pus within the pleural space. An effusion is termed complex when it develops loculations. The natural evolution of untreated simple and complicated parapneumonic effusions is to become complex and to progress to frank empyema with development of a residual cavity or entrapment of the lung by a fibrous peel or cortex.\n\nPneumonia results in parapneumonic effusion in approximately 45% of cases, although less than 5% of these progress to an empyema. Other common causes include mediastinal or pulmonary surgery and trauma. Less frequently, empyema may result from spread of infection from adjacent structures. Mortality from empyema ranges from 1% to 20%. \n\nClinical manifestations vary, depending on the underlying pulmonary process, the responsible organism, the quantity of bacteria and fluid in the pleural space, the stage of the disease, and the host defense mechanisms. The clinical presentation can range from an absence of symptoms to a severe febrile illness with toxemia and shock. In general, it is difficult to distinguish patients with infected pleural effusions from those with sterile parapneumonic effusions on the basis of history and physical examination alone. Clinical manifestations include fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough with mucopurulent sputum. Physical examination often reveals decreased breath sounds, dull percussion, and restricted respiratory excursions. \n\nWith the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-1940s, a significant shift occurred in the microbiology of pleural space infections. Anaerobic organisms are now the most common bacteria isolated from infected pleural effusions, being identified in up to 75% of cases, either alone (35%) or in combination with aerobic organisms (40%). Up to 35% of established empyemas have negative Gram stain evaluations and many patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions have negative culture results. Staphylococcus aureus is a relatively common cause of empyema in otherwise healthy adults, children and in patients who have had chest trauma or prior surgery, whereas alcoholic males are particularly susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. \n\nThoracentesis plays a critical role in the management of pleural effusions and in 90% of adult cases yields useful information. Fluid is removed and samples obtained for measurement of pH, glucose, LDH, protein, and differential cell count. An exudate is defined by: (1) a ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein greater than 0.5, (2) a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH greater than 0.6, or (3) a pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds of the upper normal limit for serum or >200 IU [3] . A transudate does not meet any of the above three criteria. \n\nIf the patient has a transudative effusion, no further laboratory tests on the pleural fluid are indicated. If the patient has an exudative pleural effusion, the remaining pleural fluid is sent for WBC and differential, cytologic examination, Gram's stain and cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacteria and fungi if clinically indicated. The aspiration of frank pus confirms the presence of empyema and establishes an absolute indication for urgent drainage of the pleural space. In this instance, Gram's stain and culture are the only laboratory studies necessary to guide initial therapy. Pleural fluid Gram's stains can identify pathogens in 55% to 65% of patients with established empyemas. \nThe posterior-anterior and lateral chest radiographs are the best initial diagnostic modalities. When the patient is upright, free pleural fluid first accumulates in the lowest part of the hemithorax—the posterior costophrenic angles. Lateral decubitus views allow detection of 50 to 100 ml of fluid and the presence of loculations if the fluid fails to layer out along the dependent chest. In the view with the involved side superior, the free fluid layers against the mediastinum and one can assess how much of the radiodensity is due to the fluid and how much is due to a parenchymal infiltrate. In the view with the involved side dependent, the amount of free pleural fluid can be semi-quantitated by measuring the distance from the chest wall to the outside of the lung. If the thickness of fluid exceeds 10 mm, a diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated. However, it is not necessary to tap all parapneumonic effusions, especially if the volume of fluid remains small, the patient is doing well, the fluid moves freely, or serial roentgenograms show improvement. \n\nCT is of great value in the overall evaluation of parapneumonic effusions and should be done early in the assessment of patients with complex parapneumonic effusion or empyema. CT is helpful in (1) differentiating pleural fluid from peripheral parenchymal infiltrates or pleural thickening, (2) evaluating the parenchymal disease, (3) determining the presence of loculations, (4) characterizing the pleural surfaces, and (5) guiding and assessing therapy. Complicated effusions and empyemas are frequently associated with nearby pulmonary consolidation and can be mistaken for a lung abscess. A lung abscess usually presents as a poorly defined, roughly spherical mass surrounded by consolidated but non compressed lung. An empyema is usually elongated, conforms to the shape of the chest wall, and compresses the adjacent lung. Its wall is thin and uniform and the interface angle with the chest wall is obtuse. The margins of the empyema cavity are composed of inflamed visceral and parietal pleura that enhance after administration of intravenous contrast. The visceral and parietal layers are separated by the interposed empyema fluid, giving rise to the “split pleura sign”.\n\nUS is widely available, provides guidance for thoracentesis or pleural catheter placement, and can be transported to the bedside. US is particularly useful for sampling fluid that does not layer freely on decubitus films, and can distinguish solid from liquid pleural abnormalities better than chest roentgenography. The presence of discrete pleural septations has prognostic importance because loculated collections require drainage for their resolution. Computed tomography, however, gives additional information not obtained by US.\n\nThe sine qua non of empyema management is early, adequate, and dependent drainage. The therapeutic armamentarium for parapneumonic effusion or empyema consists of antibiotic therapy, thoracentesis, chest tube drainage, image-guided percutaneous catheter drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic agents, and a variety of surgical drainage procedures, including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy.", "keywords": "empyemaeffusionthoracentesis", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2608_synpic20532"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2608_synpic20532", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2608_synpic20532.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Axial CT of the chest demonstrates a large left sided pleural fluid collection with surrounding enhancing rind consistent with an empyema.

The nomenclature for the species of Pneumocystis that infects humans has been changed from Pneumocystis carinii to Pneumocystis jirovecii.  Typical immunocompromised states include AIDS patients with CD4 counts<200, long term corticosteroid therapy, organ transplants, and chemotherapy patients.  \n\nIn immunocompetent patients presenting symptoms develop rapidly (over 4-10 days); and include hypoxia, dry cough, and fever.  A less specific, indolent pattern (over 2-6 weeks) is more common in immunocompromised patients; including fever, malaise, and dyspnea.    \n\nClinical suspicion should be high in a hypoxic, immunocompromised patient with ground-glass opacities on plain film or high-resolution CT.\n\nCXR: Perihilar or diffuse ground-glass opacities early, which can advance to a consolidative appearance if untreated.  There is a slight upper lobe predominance, which may be associated with prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine.  Upper lobe thin-walled cysts can develop in 30% of AIDS patients, which can result in pneumothorax.  \n\nUncommon plain film findings include multiple pulmonary nodules (some of which may cavitate), a miliary pattern, reticular opacities, and asymmetric consolidation.\n\nPleural effusions and enlarged lymph nodes are associated rarely.\n\nCT:  Ground glass opacities on HRCT are the predominant finding.  Superimposed smooth intralobular and interlobular septal thickening can also be seen (“crazy-paving”).  Upper lobe cysts can be demonstrated more frequently on CT.

By placing the focal zone at or slightly below the area of interest, one is able to identify this characteristic rapidly fluctuating mixture of Doppler signals.  \n\nIn this particular case, the demonstration of the twinkle artifact is helpful because the non-obstructing renal calculi was diagnosed, sparing the patient further diagnostic tests or interventions. \n\nA few months later, the same patient underwent a abdominal CT which confirmed the presence of renal calculi.", "topic_title": "Nephrolithiasis", "acr_code": "8.1", "category": "Radiologic Sign or Finding", "disease_discussion": "Lesions/Condition:  Nephrolithiasis\n\nAssociations/Predisposing  Factors:  \n\nDietary:  High content of animal protein.

Stones smaller than 5 mm may also appear as an echogenic focus, however, often lack an acoustic shadow creating difficulty in differentiating the stone from the echogenic renal sinus.

The are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumors with an estimated 1.5 clinical cases per 100,000.  Autopsy case incidence is higher at 650 per 100,000.  \n \nOver 2/3 of carcinoid tumors are in the GI tract, but can also occur in lungs, ovaries, testes, mediastinum, kidneys, etc.  More than 95% of GI carcinoids originate in only 3 sites: appendix, ileum, and rectum.  Carcinoids are most often benign, but those affecting the ileum and bronchus are frequently malignant.  \n\nCLINICAL FEATURES: \nSigns and symptoms vary depending on size, location, and metastases.  Most tumors are slow growing and asymptomatic until late disease.  Metastatic disease can occur but is not common.  Carcinoid tumors can be endocrinologically inert or secrete several hormones (serotonin, histamine, kallikrein, insulin, etc) which are responsible for carcinoid syndrome (cutaneous flushing, venous telangiectasia, diarrhea, bronchospasm, cardiac valvular lesions).   \n\nDIAGNOSIS: \nMany carcinoid tumors are found incidentally on endoscopic or radiographic procedures.  The most useful test for carcinoid syndrome is to measure 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-HIAA.  Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the tumor must be localized using abdominal CT and indium-111 octreotide imaging.  If metastases are suspected, then use of CT or MRI is recommended to rule out liver metastases.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nCarcinoid crisis - life threatening form of carcinoid syndrome that results from the release of extremely high amounts of biologically active compounds (catecholamines, etc) from the tumor.  Symptoms include flushing, diarrhea, tachycardia, arrhythmias, blood pressure fluctuation, bronchospasm, and altered mental status.\n\nMANAGEMENT:\nLocalize tumor and metastases by CT and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.

Noncontrast CT scan rules out hemorrhagic stroke immediately, but CT has poor sensitivity for demonstrating acute ischemic strokes.  However, more advanced neuroimaging, to include MRI with diffusion weighting has been used to better identify acute infarct.  Additionally, CT and MR perfusion imaging are able to detect early hemodynamic changes associated with ischemia and infarction.  Perfusion imaging can be useful to differentiate between potential salvageable ischemic tissue and tissue infarction.  This has many treatment implications, to include identification of patients amenable to catheter-directed therapies such as intraarterial thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, even if the patient is outside the accepted 3-hour time window for IV thrombolysis.\n     Measurements for brain perfusion include mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral blood flow (CBF).  For CT Perfusion, a tissue-at-risk map can be generated from these perfusion maps based on minimum threshold values for CBV and CBF to maintain brain viability.  Regions of increased MTT and mildly decreased CBF represent the penumbra and therefore are at risk for infarction.  Due to autoregulation and collateralization, CBV is usually last to be affected by ischemic events and the CBV is maintained as normal or slightly increased.  However, infarction is characterized by increased MTT coupled with significantly decreased CBF and CBV.

Once an obstruction has occurred, gastric, pancreatic, biliary and small bowel fluid as well as swallowed air will begin to collect proximal to the obstruction dilating the small bowel and causing colicky symptoms.  Distal to the obstruction the bowel contents will empty.  The eventual radiographic picture is that of dilated small bowel with air fluid levels and a preponderance of fluid with little if any gas distal in the small intestine or colon.  If the bowel dilates with air it assumes a step ladder configuration.  Differential air fluid levels within the same intestinal loop can be seen in either an adynamic ileus or a bowel obstruction and are not helpful in distinguishing the two.  The presence of a large amount of fluid is more suggestive of an obstruction.  If small amounts of air are trapped in between the plicae circulares, a line of small round air collections, the \"string of pearls,\" (Film .2Z) can be seen, as in this case.  This finding is indicative of large amounts of fluid and is more suggestive of an obstruction than an adynamic ileus.  The extent of small bowel gas may be a clue as to the site of the obstruction.  Proximal obstructions may result in a fairly benign appearing radiograph.  One third of patients will present with a history and plain film findings sufficiently characteristic that further radiographic work-up is unnecessary.  If a contrast study is performed, barium is the agent of choice because water soluble contrast material becomes too dilute to pin-point a site of obstruction.  Administering the barium through an already indwelling long arm tube or radiographically placed duodenal catheter may be a more expeditious way of pin-pointing the site of a partial obstruction.  With a complete obstruction it is difficult to get the barium column to reach the site of a distal obstruction using any technique without causing the patient either increased discomfort or emesis of the barium.  Many surgeons are content with supportive plain films and clinical history to justify a surgical approach.  \n\nApproximately 60% of mechanical small bowel obstructions occur because of adhesions.  Approximately 20% of obstructions are from hernias, the vast majority of which are external hernias.  Included in this group are inguinal, femoral, umbilical and incisional hernias.  The diagnosis of an incisional hernia can be very difficult and requires oblique views of the abdomen.  Obstructing inguinal hernias in adults are usually symptomatic and readily apparent.  In the neonate, however, an obstructing inguinal hernia may be difficult to diagnose clinically.  A close search for air below the pubic ramus should always be made when a small bowel obstruction is present.  Internal hernias account for less than 5% of obstructing hernias and rarely have a specific enough plain film picture to allow for diagnosis.  \n\nA rounded soft tissue density associated with an obstructed small bowel pattern should always raise the possibility of a closed loop obstruction, representing a twisted or adhesed isolated loop of intestine blocked at both ends.  Other causes of small bowel obstruction include benign or malignant primary tumors, large gallstones, intussusceptions, Crohn's disease, and perforated appendix with abscess formation.\n\nIt should be remembered that the plain film diagnosis of a small bowel obstruction should be made with correlation with the patient's clinical picture.

Skip lesions may also occur, with eventual involvement of the colon in 70%. Initial presentation is in the teens or early twenties, with males and females equally affected. Onset may be insidious, with initial symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea and low grade fever, to more acute symptoms resembling appendicitis. The earliest macroscopic manifestation is apthoid ulceration of the gut mucosa with eventual enlargement of the ulcers and confluence thereof. Microscopically small granulomas resembling sarcoid granulomas are found, containing multinucleated giant cells of Langhans’ type. Interestingly, such granulomas are more frequently found in the lymph nodes draining the diseased segment, and less so in the segment itself.  Ultimate complete loss of mucosa, fibrosis and narrowing of the lumen is a common outcome. Associated inflammation leads to mass effect displacing or effacing structures in the right lower quadrant. Due to the transmural ulceration fistulization between adjacent loops of small bowel and the colon may be seen, as well as fistulization between the bladder, vagina, ureter, and skin.  The proximal small bowel, stomach, and esophagus may also be affected, in that decreasing order of frequency. Such proximal involvement, however, rarely occurs independent of terminal ileal involvement. \n\n\nPrevious studies of nuclear medicine inflammatory bowel imaging demonstrate good correlation between locale of uptake on In-111/WBC scanning and region of bowel affected, however Tc-99m HMPAO/WBC scanning has been shown to demonstrate better localization properties. Additionally, Tc-99m provides a lesser radiation dose to the spleen by virtue of its shorter half life (6hrs vs 67 hrs); thus it is preferred in the pediatric population. Finally, Tc-99mHMPAO/WBC results may be obtained as rapidly as within one hour after injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Should In-111/WBC scanning be done, however, initial imaging should be done at 4 hours rather than the typical 24 hour delay. This is because there will be shedding of leukocytes from the inflamed bowel and peristalsis will carry the labeled leukocytes distally, possibly resulting in inaccuracy in determining site of inflammation. \n\nUse of  F-18 FDG PET scanning in the evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease is promising. In a study of 86 patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease undergoing PET scanning followed by endoscopic confirmation PET was found to have a sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 83%, positive predictive value of 93%, and negative predictive value of 95%.", "keywords": "Crohn's DiseasePositron Emission TomographyTechnitium 99m HMPAO WBC", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1771_synpic16984"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1771_synpic16984", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1771_synpic16984.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Patient B.

The patient was therefore referred to urology for management of this incidental renal mass.  Tissue diagnosis was obtained during partial nephrectomy.", "treatment": "Laparoscopic left partial nephrectomy preformed along with follow-up imaging.", "discussion": "Renal cell carcinoma, the most common primary tumor of the kidney, is found incidentally in many patients with the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging.  In fact, as many as one-half of renal cell carcinomas are discovered incidentally at early stages when they are asymptomatic.  CT has also played an essential role in staging renal cell carcinoma in order to guide prognosis and surgical planning.  The patient in this case underwent partial nephrectomy for his renal cell carcinoma.  As a result, this case generates several interesting questions.  What is the standard protocol for staging renal cell carcinoma with CT?  What staging systems exist for renal cell carcinoma and what are their differences?  Finally, what factors determine the use of radical nephrectomy versus nephron-sparing surgical techniques?\n\t\nOnce a renal cell carcinoma is suspected incidentally, there is a standard protocol for work-up using CT.  First, an unenhanced CT is preformed to use as a baseline once intravenous contrast material is administered.  Due to a significant vascular supply, renal cell carcinomas enhance following administration of contrast.  12 HU of enhancement suggest possible malignancy.  Following the administration of contrast, images are obtained during the corticomedullary phase, nephrographic phase, and excretory phase.  \n      \nThe corticomedullary phase occurs between 25 and 70 seconds after injection and primarily enhances the renal cortex.  While not perfect for detecting small lesions, this phase can aid in diagnosing venous extension of the tumor.  The nephrographic phase, which occurs between 80 and 180 seconds following injection, is best for detecting renal masses and analyzing indeterminate lesions.  Finally, the excretory phase begins 180 seconds following injection and helps evaluate the collecting system, as well as the calices and renal pelvis.  \n     \n Renal cell carcinoma has two potential staging systems: the Robson classification and the TMN classification.  CT is reported to be 91% accurate in staging renal cell carcinoma.  The TMN classification is considered more precise because of its clear definition of the anatomic extent of the tumor.  With respect to the TMN classification, T1 is reserved for tumors less than 7 cm and T2 for tumors greater than 7 cm.  T3 is broken down into three groups based on tumor position.  T3a indicates spread to the perinephric fat.  T3b indicates that the tumor is present in the renal vein only.  T3c describes a tumor in the infradiaphragmatic IVC.  T4a and T4b describe tumors with direct invasion of adjacent organs and presence in the supradiaphragmatic IVC, respectively.  N1-3 are reserved for regional lymph node metastases and M1a-d for distant metastases.  \n    \nThe Robson classification is staged I-IV.  I is given to a tumor confined within the renal capsule.  II indicates spread to the perinephric fat.  IIIA describes the presence of a venous thrombus, whereas IIIB describes regional lymph node metastases.  IVA indicates direct invasion of adjacent organs and IVB indicates distant metastases.  An important downfall of the Robson classification is that it uses stage III to describe both patients with venous extension alone and patients with regional lymph node metastases.  The treatment for these two groups of patients varies significantly.  Venous extension of the tumor can be treated surgically, whereas lymph node metastases indicate a need for palliative therapy.  \n     \nDue to the rapid increase in incidental discovery of renal cell carcinoma, many tumors are small in size and early-stage.  Therefore, nephron-sparing surgery is often an option.  The procedure consists of excision of the renal tumor and obtaining 0.5 cm margins of normal renal tissue and preserving the largest amount of functioning renal parenchyma.  This procedure is particularly desirable when radical nephrectomy would lead to dialysis.  Therefore, it is indicated in patients with a solitary functioning kidney, compromised renal function, or bilateral tumors.  In addition, data indicates that small <4 cm in diameter lesions, which are polar, cortical, and a safe distance away from the renal hilum and collecting systems, have similar survival rates for the nephron-sparing procedure and radical nephrectomy.  The size and position of the patient’s tumor in this case made him a good candidate for the nephron-sparing procedure.", "topic_title": "Renal Cell Carcinoma", "acr_code": "8.3", "category": "Neoplasm, carcinoma", "disease_discussion": "Renal cell carcinoma is the most common primary tumor of the kidney and accounts for 2.6 percent of all adult cancers.  While the cause is unknown, cigarette smoking has been identified as an environmental risk factor.  Sporadic tumors are most common, but familial settings, such as von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, have been identified.  The carcinoma develops from the proximal tubule cells of the kidney.  Clear cell, papillary, chromophobe, collecting duct, and sarcomatoid are the different histologic types.  These different patterns do not affect treatment.  \n\nRenal cell carcinoma has two potential staging systems: the Robson classification and the TMN classification.

CT is the most valuable imaging modality.  It can confirm the nature of the mass and stage the tumor by providing visualization of the lymph nodes, renal vein, and hepatic involvement.  The contralateral kidney and other body organs can also be examined.  \n\nTreatment for renal cell carcinoma  varies based on the patient.  Radical nephrectomy is common for a localized renal cell carcinoma.  The indications for partial nephrectomy are reviewed in the discussion.  Radiofrequency and cryosurgical ablation are new techniques being studied.  Chemotherapy is not effective in treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Cryoreductive nephrectomy is recommended for patients who are in good status and have metastatic primary disease.

The two main types are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Although squamous cell constitutes 95% of esophageal cancers worldwide, adenocarcinoma has steadily increased to be the major histological type in the US since the 1970s.\n\nAdenocarcinoma affects white males in the 6th or 7th decade and is most commonly located in the distal esophagus.  Risk factors include gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett’s esophagus where there is replacement of normal squamous lining with intestinal-type columnar epithelium.  Interestingly, these histological changes were found in patients without reflux symptoms. In a Swedish population-based study, 40% of patients with cancer did not have symptoms at least weekly.  In comparison, squamous cell cancer of esophagus is located in proximal-mid esophagus, affects black males, and is commonly associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption. \n\nCommon presenting symptoms of esophageal cancer are dysphagia, weight loss, GERD odynophagia, and dyspnea. These symptoms, especially any evidence of mechanical obstruction, should prompt an upper endoscopy where biopsies can be obtained. The primary tumor can then be imaged suing CT and endoscopic ultrasound. CT provides a general overview of the cancer and demonstrates adjacent organ involvement, although esophageal wall layers are not easily distinguished. EUS is gaining popularity due to its strength in visualizing the wall layers. Its drawbacks include operator skill and viewing “hard to reach” tumors. \n\nOnce the diagnosis of the tumor is made, imaging to rule out metastatic disease should be performed. Intravenous-contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis remains the gold standard although sensitivity is dependent on the size of the lesion. MRI and US modalities can be used to further characterize metastatic lesions. Positron Emission Tomography is a new tool that visualizes the higher rate of glucose uptake by malignant tissue versus normal, thus, providing more information about metastatic disease. \n\nAppropriate imaging allows clinicians to properly stage the tumor, which directly affects the treatment options and prognosis. Well localized tumors can be resected and have the best 5-year survival of 65-85%. More invasive tumors and those with distant metastses are not surgical candidates and are treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy for palliation. The overall 5yr survival of esophageal cancer is 12-15%.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nElton, Eric. “Esophageal Cancer,” Disease-A-Mouth, V51, N12 (2005) 664-684.\n\nKorst, R and Altorki,N. “Imaging for Esophageal Tumors,” Radiologic Clinics of North America 43(2005) 611-619.\n\nPatel, A and Buenaventura, P. “Current Staging of Esophageal Carcinoma,” Surgical Clinics of North America 85 (2005) 555-567.", "topic_title": "Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction", "acr_code": "7.3", "category": "Neoplasm, carcinoma", "disease_discussion": "Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction is notable in that its incidence that increased more than any other malignancy in the western world.

Anomalous drainage of the right pulmonary vein to the inferior vena cava (scimitar syndrome) can present as a left to right shunt in patients with volume loss of the right hemithorax and a peculiar comma shaped density in the right lung base.  Anomalous drainage of the right upper lobe is associated with a sinus venosus type of atrial septal defect.

Approximately 10% of patients with acute appendicitis have a radiographically visible appendicolith.  One third of surgically removed appendices, however, contain an appendicolith.  The calcification may form around any type of nidus, including a piece of vegetable matter, swallowed foreign body, or even barium.  The appendicolith tends to be round or oval, smooth, and laminated (Film .2Z).  The size varies, but stones in the l-2 cm range are common with stones up to 4 cm in size having been reported.  The location is usually in the right lower quadrant, but the pelvis, right upper quadrant in the case of retrocecal appendix, and even the left upper quadrant may be the site.  \n\nThe differential diagnosis includes the following:\n\n\ta) Phlebolith - these rounded calcifications tend to occur in clusters, are usually lower in the pelvis, and frequently contain a central lucency.\n\tb) Calcified lymph node - these tend to be amorphous, irregular, \"popcorn\" calcifications.\n\tc) Ureteral calcifications - this calcification should conform to the course of the ureter and tends to be smaller and less often laminated.\n\td) Benign bone island in the iliac wing - this density will not move with changes in position of the patient, maintaining a constant location within the iliac bone.\n\nThe presence of an appendicolith is significant clinically since patients with this radiograph finding are more likely to have appendicitis complicated with perforation or abscess.  This is especially true in children.  \n\nThe plain film diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the absence of an appendicolith can be difficult with the plain film demonstrating abnormalities in approximately one half of patients.  The following radiographic findings have been described, but no one of these is as helpful as an appendicolith.  \n\n\t1) Abnormal bowel gas pattern.  The bowel gas pattern in acute appendicitis can be anywhere from normal to consistent with a complete small bowel obstruction.  A local ileus in the right lower quadrant with air fluid levels can be seen.  Occasionally fluid-filled right lower quadrant small bowel loops may present as a soft tissue mass.  A dilated transverse colon in pediatric patients with a perforated appendix has also been described.  \n\t2) Abnormal cecum and ascending colon.  Local inflammation and edema may cause thickening of the colon wall and widen the haustra.  A cecal air fluid level may be present.  \n\t3) Extraluminal soft tissue mass.  This finding can be seen in up to one third of patients with perforation.  A combination of edema, fluid, and fluid-filled loops of small bowel produce the effect.  A mottled gas collection within the soft tissue mass is highly suggestive of an abscess.  \n\t4) Obliteration of normal fat planes.  Sufficient inflammation from appendicitis may alter the water density of the surrounding fat and obscure the right properitoneal flank stripe, psoas muscle, or obturator muscle.  \n\t5) A small amount of free intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal air may rarely be present.\n\nThe use of the barium enema, ultrasound, and CT in diagnosing acute appendicitis will be discussed in a separate section.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1648_synpic20206"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1648_synpic20206", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1648_synpic20206.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Sequential CT axial images demonstrate a discrete calcific density representing an appendicolith near the origin of a dilated tubular structure that measured approximately 8mm in diameter.

The definitive diagnosis was made with bronchoscopy and histologic examination, which was consistent with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.\n\n             The American Cancer Society estimated over 160,000 deaths in the United States from lung cancer in 2004, and 87% of all deaths from lung cancer are attributed to tobacco use1.

The former three are distinguished from the latter as non-small cell tumors, in contradistinction to small cell carcinoma, which is generally faster growing and will more likely respond to chemotherapy. Small cell carcinoma only accounts for about 20% of all lung cancers, while the remaining 80% are mostly non-small cell tumors. The type of non-small cell carcinoma seen in this patient, squamous cell, accounts for 20-30% of all lung cancers. It can be distinguished histologically based upon keratin production and the presence of intercellular bridges as seen on light microscopy. \n\n             In terms of clinical presentation, cough is present in 45-75% of patients with lung cancer2, and is the most common associated symptom. Squamous cell carcinoma in particular may be associated with elevated serum calcium levels (not noted in this patient) secondary to production of a parathyroid-like hormone, although hypercalcemia may also be the result of metastatic bone disease. Initial workup includes a chest x-ray with two views. While most lesions, even those less than 3 cm in diameter (i.e., T1 lesions) can be identified with radiographs, CT is, of course, more sensitive. \n\n             Imaging is also a necessary tool in terms of staging. CT is helpful for identifying the most common sites of metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma—specifically, metastatic liver or adrenal disease, and these organs are generally assessed regardless of whether or not the patient is symptomatic. Other imaging studies for staging are generally reserved for patients whose presentation may suggest involvement of other organs3, such as the brain or the bones. PET may be useful in finding metastatic disease, and according to one source, “Currently, the accuracy of PET in the detection of M stage is 96%”.4 This patient’s PET scan revealed an area of increased radiotracer uptake consistent with malignancy in the lower lobe of the right lung, and was otherwise normal.\n\n             Treatment options and prognosis for non-small cell carcinoma of the lung vary depending on the type of tumor, the degree of differentiation, and the stage of disease.

While stage III-A is technically operable, the role of surgery in stage III disease is somewhat controversial.

During the first surgery, the patient was intubated with a cuffed 6.5mm endotracheal tube. During the second surgery, the anesthesiologist could only pass a 5mm uncuffed tube.After the surgeries she developed worsening inspiratory and expiratory stridor. \n\nPertinent past history is that the patient experienced her first episode of epistaxis several years prior to surgery and had multiple subsequent clinical visits for sinusitis.  She was diagnosed with erosive chronic sinusitis, for which the surgeries were performed. She also has a remote history of migratory arthralgias/joint effusions/fevers and ulcerative colitis (diagnosed by colonscopy). \n\nIn regards to her acute presentation, she was referred to a pediatric pulmonologist for evaluation of her stridor.\n\n1. In retrospect, many if not all, of the patient's prior illnesses (migratory arthralgias, ulcerative colitis, and sinusits) were likely a manifestation of Wegener's.\n\n2. Virtual bronchoscopy is an expanding technical application of raw data obtained from CT examinations. Computer \"Navigator\" software converts the raw data into cine-3D images which can be used to simulate bronchoscopy.  In this specific case, virtual bronchoscopy was very helpful to the pulmonologist who determined to limit his actual examination to the larynx due to the stenotic/edematous appearance of the subglottic region seen on virtual bronchoscopy. He did not want to risk further inflamation of the already critically stenotic airway. Video of the actual laryngoscopy confirmed anatomy and pathology seen with virtual images.", "topic_title": "Wegener's Granulomatosis", "acr_code": "2.2", "category": "Idiopathic or Unknown", "disease_discussion": "WEGENER’S GRANULOMATOSIS is a systemic vasculitis which most commonly involves the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys and less commonly the eyes, joints, skin, neurologic, cardiac and gastrointestinal tissues.   The disease was first described in 1931 and 1936 by H. Klinger and F. Wegener, respectively.  \n\nETIOLOGY: The cause of Wegener’s granulomatosis is not yet known.  Granuloma formation, altered immune reactivity, immune complex deposition, and altered cellular immune responses are believed to play significant roles.  There may be a genetic predisposition. [1]\n\nINCIDENCE: In the United States, the disease frequency is approximately 1 in 30,000,  with mean age of onset of 40, equal prevalence in men and women, and increased prevalence in whites.  Old data indicated that the disease was rare in children and that children accounted for only 0.1% of cases, but the most recent NIH data demonstrates that children and adolescents account for approximately 15% of affected individuals. [2]\n\nPATHOLOGY: The classic histopathology in Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis involving small arteries and veins, most reliably found on biopsies of the lung. Upper respiratory tract biopsies, including the nasal septum, sinus, and trachea, most often show non-specific acute and chronic inflammation with or without giant cells and generally without true vasculitis.  Renal biopsies typically show focal segmental glomerulonephritis, with crescent formation and necrosis in more severe forms. \n\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: The spectrum of clinical features and organ system involvement in Wegener's granulomatosis is broad.  As a multisystem disorder predominantly involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys, clinical manifestations vary from \"classic,\" with sinusitis, serous otitis media, rhinitis with nasal ulcerations, cough, hemoptysis, and constitutional symptoms, to \"fulminant,\" with rapidly progressive renal failure and respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit management, to \"mild,\" with arthralgias, polymyalgia rheumatica-type symptoms, or inflammatory eye disease as examples. [1] \n\nSinusitis is present at initial presentation in about one half to two thirds of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is seen in 85 percent of cases during the entire course of disease.  A computed tomographic scan of the sinuses is often anatomically more informative than are plain radiographs, especially in the setting of destructive and erosive bone changes. \n\nAlthough laryngotracheal disease in Wegener's granulomatosis may be asymptomatic, clinical presentations may range from subtle hoarseness to stridor and life-threatening upper airway obstruction.  The most characteristic lesion is that of subglottic stenosis, which occurs in up to 16 percent of patients. In pediatric and adolescent patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, the frequency of subglottic stenosis is dramatically increased, reaching an alarming 48 percent. Direct laryngoscopy may reveal active erythematous, friable mucosa or bland scar.  Tracheal tomograms, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance imaging may be useful adjuncts in the diagnosis of subglottic stenosis. Only 20 percent of lesions diminish with immunosuppressivetherapy alone, whereas 80 percent are fixed or irreversible owing to chronic fibrosis. [2]\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS: in the past 15 years, c-ANCA and its relationship to Wegener's granulomatosis have been studied. Clearly, this test is helpful in Wegener's granulomatosis, particularly during active generalized disease, and may be confirmatory. Because reports of false positives are increasing and because sensitivity varies from 30 to 90% in a clinician's diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, depending on the extent of disease and disease activity level, the test cannot be used as a sole diagnostic criterion for Wegener's granulomatosis. Radiologic imaging studies are helpful in diagnosing Wegener's granulomatosis, including chest and sinus radiographs and computed tomography. The differential diagnosis is quite broad and depends on the patient's signs and symptoms. When the classic triad of involvement occurs, with confirmatory tissue biopsy and a positive c-ANCA, the diagnosis is easy. When the process is early and/or limited to the upper airway or kidney, the diagnosis is clinically challenging. [1]\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  Imaging studies of the paranasal sinuses may reveal characteristic findings in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. Plain film findings include mucosal thickening, opacification, air-fluid levels, and bony sclerosis or frank obliteration . Computed tomographic findings include bilateral sinus opacification, orbital mass, bone erosion, septal perforation, and mucosal thickening [3]\n\nTracheobronchial involvement by Wegener’s  manifests on CT as mural thickening and narrowing of involved airways.  90% of inflammatory lesions are located in the subglottic region with circumferential tracheal involvement and narrowing occur with a length of involvement ranging from 5 to 45 mm.  \n\nOn CT, the most common finding of pulmonary Wegener’s is multiple irregularly marginated nodules, which can range from 2 to 20 in number and from 2 to 90 mm in size. Areas of opacification ranging from ground-glass attenuation to frank consolidation are the second most common CT pattern of pulmonary Wegener’s and often represent findings of pulmonary hemorrhage . [4]\n\nTREATMENT:  Treatment depends on the severity and location of the disease.  A multidisciplinary approach is often needed.  Glucocorticoids and cyclophoshamide are the primary medications used for treatment.  Combination therapy with oral daily cyclophophamide and glucocorticoids is considered the standard therapy.  Methotrexate at times is used as an alternative to cyclophosphamide. Surgical treatment is often required to treat sinus disease, tracheal disease, and less frequently to provide renal transplant. \n \nPROGNOSIS:  Whereas Wegener's granulomatosis was once an invariably fatal disease, the combination of cyclophosphamide and prednisone has provided remission in 75% of all patients and improvement in 90%, as evidenced in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) series of long-term follow-up studies. However, relapses occur in at least 50% of those achieving remission at any time from several months to 15 to 20 years after stopping cytotoxic therapy.

About 90% to 95% of hiatal hernias found by radiograph are sliding hernias, and the rest are paraesophageal or mixed.  Most sliding hiatal hernias are small and of little clinical significance. Patients with symptomatic paraesophageal hernias are most often middle-aged to elderly.  Many patients with small, simple sliding hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. The main clinical significance of the sliding hiatal hernia is its contribution to gastroesophageal reflux . In addition to heartburn and regurgitation, patients with large sliding hiatal hernias may complain of dysphagia or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen. In a prospective, population-based study the risk of iron-deficiency anemia was found to be increased  in adults with hiatal hernia. On chest radiograph a hiatal hernia may be noted as a soft tissue density in the retrocardiac area. Hiatal hernias are most often diagnosed on upper gastrointestinal barium radiographic studies. At endoscopy the gastroesophageal junction is noted to be proximal to the impression of the diaphragm. [1]\n\nPatients with paraesophageal and mixed hiatal hernias are rarely completely asymptomatic if closely questioned. About half of patients with paraesophageal hernias have gastroesophageal reflux. Other symptoms include dysphagia, chest pain, vague postprandial discomfort, and shortness of breath. A substantial number of patients have chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. If the hernia is complicated by gastric volvulus, acute abdominal pain and retching will occur, often progressing rapidly to a surgical emergency. A paraesophageal or mixed hiatal hernia may be seen on chest radiograph as an abnormal soft tissue density (often with a gas bubble) in the mediastinum. Upper gastrointestinal radiograph is the best diagnostic study. [1]\n\nHiatal hernias are occasionally complicated by volvulus. The stomach is normally fixed in position by ligamentous attachments to the duodenum, spleen, liver, and diaphragm. Laxity of these ligaments, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, adhesions, gastric tumor, or masses in adjacent organs may predispose to volvulus. In about one third of cases the volvulus occurs below the diaphragm. In the other two thirds of cases volvulus occurs above the diaphragm in association with a diaphragmatic hernia. Sliding hiatal hernias are not associated with gastric volvulus.  Gastric volvulus may be mesenteroaxial or organoaxial. In about 60% of cases gastric volvulus is organoaxial: the stomach twists along its long axis. This axis usually passes through the gastroesophageal and gastropyloric junctions. The antrum rotates anteriorly and superiorly, the fundus posteriorly and inferiorly, twisting the greater curvature at some point along its length. This type of volvulus is commonly associated with a diaphragmatic hernia. Organoaxial volvulus is usually an acute event. Vascular compromise and gastric infarction may occur. The other major type of gastric volvulus is mesenteroaxial, in which the stomach folds on its short axis running across from the lesser curvature to the greater curvature, and the antrum twists anteriorly and superiorly. [1]\n\nSimple sliding hiatal hernias do not require treatment. Patients with symptomatic giant sliding hiatal hernias, paraesophageal, and mixed hernias should be offered surgery. Many experts suggest that surgery should be offered to patients with asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias, because about 30% of these patients will develop complications if left untreated. Many surgeons routinely perform a fundoplication on all repairs, both to prevent postoperative reflux esophagitis and to fix the stomach in the abdomen. Less commonly a gastrostomy is used to fix the stomach in position. Patients with sliding hiatal or paraesophageal hernias may have shortening of the esophagus. This makes it difficult to restore the gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragm without tension. In such cases an extra length of neoesophagus can be constructed from the proximal stomach (Colles-Nissen procedure). Paraesophageal and mixed hernias can be repaired through the chest or abdomen, with open or laparoscopic techniques. Compared with open repair, laparoscopic repair is associated with less blood loss, fewer overall complications, shorter hospital stay, and quicker return to normal activities. Long-term results are probably equal with either approach. Potential surgical complications include esophageal and gastric perforation, pneumothorax, and liver laceration. Potential long-term complications may include dysphagia if the wrap is too tight or gastroesophageal reflux if the fundoplication breaks down or migrates into the chest. Recurrence rates are about 10 [1]\n \n\n1.

(3)  GE junction adenocarcinoma can either arise from the esophagus or proximal gastric area.  It is very difficult to determine the primary cancer site. (1) Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma include familial adenomatous polyposis, gastric adenomas/ dysplasia,  chronic atrophic gastritis,  gastric metaplasia, diet high in nitrates, and Helicobacter pylori infection.

The usual age of presentation is 20-40 years of age after the growth plate has been obliterated. Patients usually present with tenderness and swelling over the primary site and rarely pathologic fracture. GCTs comprise 5-9% of all primary bone tumors, 25% of benign bone tumors and are the 6th most common primary bone neoplasm. The majority of GCTs are benign with approximately 5-10% malignant, which are indistinguishable radiographically.  60% occur in the long bones and almost all GCTs involve the articular end of the bone with the following most common sites: proximal tibia, distal femur, distal radius and proximal humerus.   \n\nInitial evaluation is usually with radiography, which  often reveals a geographic, well-defined lucent lesion usually lacking sclerotic margins or periosteal reaction.  The lesion is usually in an eccentric location and usually extends to the articular surface.  Further evaluation requires CT or MRI, which can demonstrate associated soft tissue mass and full extent of the lesion.  MRI is useful in defining the full extent of the tumor in preparation for surgical resection and may occasionally reveal fluid/fluid levels or subchondral breakthrough or joint involvement. \n\nTreatment consists of surgical curettage with bone grafting or orthopedic cement or wide resection with secondary implantation of an allograft endoprosthesis.  Pathologic evaluation reveals vascular tissue with mononuclear stromal cells and multinucleated giant cells of osteoclast type.

More about general treatment for NF1 patients will be discussed in the discussion.  As for her specific findings on this CT study, treatment and follow-up are as follows:\n\nPlexiform neurofibroma:  Lesions usually involve multiple nerve fascicles with significant vascularity. Thus, surgical excision is generally difficult and frustrating, with excessive bleeding and a poor cosmetic result. Repeated debulking may be necessary for severe symptoms, and orbital evisceration for extensive cases. Radiotherapy offers no benefit. However, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, which inhibit growth of these tumors in animals, are a possible treatment in the future and are currently undergoing clinical trials.  Of concern, there is a small risk of malignant transformation of these tumors. They may occasionally erode into the anterior cranial fossa, which results in death.\n\nOptic nerve glioma:  The radiologist of this case recommended further evaluation with MRI of the brain and orbits. If the MRI is positive for an optic nerve glioma, MRI and an ophthalmic exam are repeated every 3-6 months. Otherwise, if vision is ok, observation is the treatment. If the tumor progresses, the child should be referred to neurooncology for evaluation.  Surgical excision is offered if a tumor approaches the chiasm. Surgery also is indicated for pain or disfiguring proptosis. The role of radiotherapy remains controversial; it may be associated with CNS complications. More recently, chemotherapy has shown promising results.", "discussion": "Our patient has been given the definitive diagnosis of NF1 because of the plexiform neurofibroma and sphenoid hypoplasia.

Typically, the lesion appears as a fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve, possibly involving the optic chiasm. The nerve may appear kinked with cystic spaces.\n\nIf no potential problem develops, this 2 year old needs yearly medical visits to include physical exam, ophthalmologic exam, growth measurements, assessment for precocious puberty, developmental assessment, and review of educational progress. Also, as previously mentioned, because of her tumors, she would need a follow-up MRI every 3-6 months.

It is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1 in 3000.  It involves chromosome 17, which encodes for the protein neurofibromin, which is expressed in many tissues including brain, kidney, spleen, and thymus.  Mutations leading to loss of function of this protein results in a wide spectrum of clinical findings.\n\nDiagnostic criteria were developed in 1987 by the NIH Consensus Conference (updated in 1997) and are based on clinical features. Two of the following must be present to diagnose as NF1:  6 or more caf?-au-lait macules (>5mm-prepuberty or >15mm-postpuberty), 2 or more neurofibromas of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, optic glioma, 2 or more Lisch nodules, distinctive bony lesion (i.e. sphenoid dysplasia, thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudoarthrosis), a first degree relative diagnosed with NF1.\n\nOptic nerve glioma is a pilocytic astrocytoma that primarily affects children. The lesion may be bilateral in NF1 (29% of optic gliomas are associated with NF1).  Clinical findings include gradual loss of vision, optic atrophy or edema, and exophthalmos. Eighty percent of patients experience an initial decrease in vision which then stabilizes. Hypothalamic signs, to include precocious or delayed puberty, may be seen in 22% of cases. Prognosis for vision is poor. Lesions initially confined to the optic nerve have a mortality of 10%. Lesions involving the chiasm have a mortality of 20%. With midbrain and hypothalamus involvement, the prognosis is poor, with mortality greater than 55%.\n\nPlexiform neurofibroma is the most common benign peripheral nerve tumor in the eyelid and orbit. The tumor grows along the nerve, is not encapsulated, and is invasive. Children in the first decade of life are most commonly affected. The tumor tends to grow along sensory nerves, but also may involve motor, parasympathetic, and sympathetic nerves.  Thirty one percent of plexiform neurofibromas occur in the eyelids.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus usually acquired via inhalation of dehydrated yeast cells or basidiospores that has been shown in analysis of soils to be found with pigeon excreta. Inhalation of the spores is believed to be the primary means of acquisition.  When considering the prevalence of the disease, serologic studies have demonstrated evidence of widespread subclinical infection in individuals without a history of symptomatic infection with most adults having a positive serum antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans. Thus, it appears that the subclinical primary infection is common and the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic.  Despite strong serologic evidence, symptomatic Cryptococcus remains a very rare disease in individuals without impaired immunity.  An active surveillance conducted in the early 90’s in Alabama estimated the incidence of active Cryptococcus infections at 0.84 cases per 100,000 in non-HIV individuals.  However, in patients with advanced HIV infections living in San Francisco and Atlanta in the early 90’s, the incidence was higher and was estimated to be anywhere from 17 to 66 cases per 1000 individuals.  Other patients who appear to be at increased risk include cancer patients and those individuals receiving organ transplants.

Most are asymptomatic and found as an incidental finding. \n     Malignant transformation occurs in approximately 1% of single osteochondromas, although in multiple osteochondromas, malignant change may develop in 2 to 27% of patients (particularly the femur, humerus, tibia, and innominate bone).  Most malignant transformation is to chondrosarcoma although unusual cases of osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma have been reported.  Besides bursal inflammation, pathologic fracture, and malignant transformation, osteochondromas may cause vascular and neurological complications and osseous deformities because of displacement or compression of adjacent structures.

The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related” aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.

Fibrous or calcific thickening of the pericardium may lead to constrictive pericardial disease due to restriction of cardiac motion which chronically compromises ventricular filling.  Onset of constrictive pericarditis is usually between the ages of 30-50 years and prevalence is three times greater in males than in females.  An associated protein losing enteropathy may be present.  The most common cause of constrictive pericardial disease is postpericardiotomy and hemopericardium for any reason.  The second most common cause is radiation therapy, but Coxsackie B virus, TB, uremia, connective tissue disease, neoplasm, and idiopathic etiologies may be seen.  \n\nPatients with constrictive pericarditis commonly present with symptoms of heart failure to include dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigability.  They may occasionally present with liver enlargement, ascites and later on with cirrhosis (\"cardiac cirrhosis\")secondary to chronic hepatic congestion.\n\nNormal pericardial thickness is less than 2mm.  When greater than 4mm and accompanied by clinical findings of heart failure, constrictive pericarditis is highly likely.  It is essential to realize, however, that neither pericardial thickening nor calcification is pathognomonic of constrictive pericarditis unless the patient also has concomitant symptoms of physiologic constriction.  However, 50% of patients with pericardial calcifications have constrictive pericarditis.  Pericardial thickening may be global or limited to the right side of the heart or to the right AV groove.\n\nCalcifications are seen on plain film radiography in up to 50% of patients.  Ascites and plural effusions are common.  Normal to mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is commonly seen along with small atria, dilated superior and inferior vena cava and azygos vein, and flat or straitened right heart border.\n\nEchocardiography may show thickened pericardium, abnormal septal motion, and increased left ventricular ejection fraction with a small end-diastolic volume. \n\nCT and MR imaging are excellent in depicting the pericardium, and in aiding the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, especially in difficult cases.  CT is particularly good for demonstrating pericardial thickening and calcification.  Reflux of contrast into the coronary sinus, a bowed interventricular septum, flattening of the right ventricle, ascites, and pleural effusions, may all be seen.  Both CT and MR show pericardial thickening, dilatation of the right atrium, inferior vena cava and hepatic veins along with a sigmoid septal shift (or prominent leftward septal convexity) and narrowing/reduced volume of the right ventricle.  MR may demonstrate abnormal flow mechanics in the vena cava and atria.\n\nFrom the clinical standpoint it is important to differentiate constrictive pericarditis from other restrictive myocardial diseases ( Myocarditis)since both entities have identical pathophysiologic findings on echocardiography or card cath.

It is likely multifactoral including  genetic influence, dysfunctional immune response, enteric normal flora bacteria, and other environmental factors.  It is believed to be the result of an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Most cases involve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Crohn disease typically affects the bowel asymmetrically, involving the mesenteric side more severely than the antimesenteric border. Although any area of the GI system may be affected, the most common site of disease is the ileo-cecal region, followed by the colon.  Microscopically, the initial lesion appears as a focal inflammatory infiltrate around the crypts, followed by ulceration of superficial mucosa, then by deeper invasion and non-caseating granulomas. Grossly, the early abnormality is hyperemia and edema of the involved mucosa. Later, superficial ulcers form, which become deep serpentine linear ulcers located both longitudinally and transversely giving the mucosa a “cobblestone” appearance. The lesions are often segmental; being separated by healthy areas, hence the term “skip lesions”. Transmural inflammation results in thickening of the bowel wall and narrowing of the lumen. As the disease progresses, it is complicated by obstruction, fistula formation, abscess formation, adhesions, and malabsorption.\n\nClinical: The characteristic presentation of Crohn disease is with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which may be complicated by intestinal fistula formation, obstruction, or both. Unpredictable flares and remissions with a long course characterize Crohn’s. Treatment is generally medical including antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, and sometimes antibiotics. Chronic complications include fistulas, adhesions, and marked luminal narrowing with partial bowel obstruction which may require surgery.\n\nRadiographic findings:\nRadiological evaluation includes diagnosis, evaluation of distribution, and evaluation for complications. The distribution of small bowel Crohn’s disease is best assessed by enteroclysis and CT. The terminal ileum is nearly always involved in small bowel disease and is the only site in up 30 % of patients.\n  \nSmall bowel contrast studies: The sensitivity of enteroclysis is reported as very good in detecting Crohn’s disease but often does not correlate well with disease activity. Superficial abnormalities include thickened folds due to mucosal edema, transverse and longitudinal ulcers, punctate collections of barium, and small nodules. Transmural abnormalities include deep fissures and penetrating ulcers.  Cobblestoning results from intersecting longitudinal and transverse ulcers with intervening heaped-up edematous tissue.  Deep ulcerations may result in fistulae. Thickened bowel may appear as separations of loops. Luminal narrowing is always present resulting from spasm and edema during the acute phase or fibrotic strictures in chronic disease. Ileitis can also manifest as a “sting sign” on barium study secondary to spasm or fibrotic stricture fromation.  The mesenteric aspect and adjacent mesentery are commonly affected more than the antimesenteric border. Extramural mesenteric inflammation and abscesses may induce compression and displacement of bowel loops.\n\nCross sectional imaging: Both CT and MR imaging are reported to have a sensitivity of over 95% for the detection of Crohn disease.  At more advanced stages, CT and MR imaging can help identify and characterize pathologically altered bowel segments as well as extraluminal lesions including abscesses, fat stranding, and adenopathy.

These tumors are generally discovered incidentally at autopsy or imaging studies performed for other reasons (0.08-0.2% at autopsy). Extra-adrenal sites include the pelvis, thorax and retroperitoneum. They are typically unilateral and variable in size from mm to 30cm. There is an equal incidence in males and females with slight predilection in the Caucasian population. These neoplasms typically occur in the fifth to seventh decades, and no death rate is reported in the literature due to the rarity of these tumors. \n\nCT is the imaging modality of choice for these lesions which can be diagnosed macroscopically by focal fatty density within the mass. Occasionally, discrete calcifications can be found in small amounts along with a thin rim of residual adrenal cortex. MRI can also accurately depict both microscopic and macroscopic fat through chemical shift imaging and explicit fat saturation technique. Ultrasound is typically not used for the characterization of adrenal neoplasms, but has been known to find them incidentally. \n\nIt is believed that these tumors might represent an extramedullary site of hematopoiesis or that they arise from metaplasia of the reticuloendothelial cells of capillaries in the adrenal gland in response to stimuli (ie. necrosis, infection, stress). \n\nThese lesions are usually asymptomatic but might result in complications such as rupture (rare-only 11 reported cases as of 2003), tumor necrosis and retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and mechanical compression from tumor bulk. Myelolipomas do not undergo malignant transformation and they are rarely associated with endocrine disorders. However, Conn’s and Cushing’s syndromes as well as congenital adrenal hyperplasia have been documented in the literature (25 cases reported by one study). \n\nSmall asymptomatic tumors are generally monitored clinically while symptomatic lesions are treated by adrenalectomy.

Now typically noted around the age of 4-5 years old.  If they go undetected other symptoms are determined by the middle ear structure they interfere with.  Facial nerve paralysis, conductive or sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo and extension into the middle fossa are all possibilities.  The most common complication is a conductive hearing loss due to fixation of the ossicles by the mass.  However, some large cholesteatomas can allow for sound conduction through the cholesteatoma itself.\n\nLocation: Most commonly found in the anterior superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane when found early, but as they grow they tend to migrate to the posterior hypotympanum.\n\nPathophysiology: There are four theories on how a congenital cholesteatoma is formed, the most widely accepted is the epithelial rest theory\n- Epithelial rests: Teed-Michael theory, ectodermal implants have been found in the 10 week old fetus between the first branchial cleft and pouch which is distinct from the surrounding tissue.  They have an unknown function and typically are resorbed at 33 weeks gestion.  If they do not involute then they may form a chronic cholesteatoma.  While there is histologic evidence of rests prior to 33 weeks there are now two documented histological cases such rests persisting after 33 weeks.\n- Invagination: This theory suggested that tissue from the external canal invaginates through the tympanic membrane due to a very small inflammatory injury near the neck of the malleus which causes adherence of squamous tissue to the malleus.  This may occur in utero or during childhood.   Another related theory is that there is no actual macroscopic perforation of the tympanic membrane, only microperforations of the basal layer.  This allows for squamous epithelium to enter the middle ear space.\n- Implantation: This is actually a theory against the existence of congenital cholesteatomas and implies that they are actually formed by unrecognized perforations of the tympanic membrane.\n- Metaplasia: This theory explains that epithelial tissue in the middle ear is via metaplasia to keratinizing squamous epithelium, although this theory appears to be unlikely due to the fact that most congenital cholesteatomas occur in one quadrant of the middle ear.\nHistology: Stratified squamous epithelial lined cyst which is filled with keratinous debris, this histology of a congential cholesteatoma is exactly the same as an acquired cholesteatoma.\nRadiology: High resolution CT of the temporal bone is the ideal modality for imaging congenital cholesteatomas, especially since most patients are young and without other ear pathology found in patients with aquired cholesteatomas.  On CT a cholesteatoma appears as a hypodense lesion with well defined margins which does not enhance with constrast.\nMR imaging of the temporal bone may also be used.  This will show low signal on T1W with moderately high signal on T2W images.  It does not enhance with gadolinium.  MR imaging is useful for differentiating a cholesteatoma from other intracranial processes. \n\nTreatment: Surgical resection with either complete removal of the cholesteatoma matrix or permanent exteriorization is curative.

Stones within the renal collecting system typically obstruct at one of three locations: the ureteropelvic junction, the pelvic brim, or the ureterovessicular junction.  Occasionally obstructing stones may also lodge at the bladder outlet.  When acute in onset, many patients with obstructing stone disease will present to the emergency department with acute flank pain.  The differential diagnosis consideration for such presentations can often include appendicitis, pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, and inflammatory bowel disease.  For this reason imaging typically plays an important role in diagnosis.  A study from Radiology in 2000 looking at the detection of ureteral calculi in emergency room patients determined that the sensitivity for stone detection by CT was 96%, and by ultrasound was 61% (both with specificities of 100%).\n\nIt is estimated that somewhere between 3 and 12 percent of individuals in the United States will experience symptomatic renal stones at some point in their lives.  The majority of stones (eighty percent) are composed of calcium (typically calcium oxalate and less often calcium phosphate).  The main other types include include uric acid, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and cystine stones.  Generalized risk factors for forming stones include low water intake, high protein intake, family history, urinary tract infection with a urease splitting organism (e.g. Proteus or Klebsiella), and disease states resulting in hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, or hypocitriuria.  Treatment of ureteral stones in the acute setting begins with adequate pain control. Once an obstructing stone has been identified within the collecting system, location and size of the stone plays a major role in determining management with stone size of 5mm typically representing the threshold for intervention—with stones smaller than 5mm being managed conservatively (pain control, oral hydration, and urine straining for spontaneous passage), and stones greater than or equal to 5mm being managed with some sort of intervention (e.g. lithotripsy, cystoscopy, etc).", "keywords": "kidney stonesnephrolithiasisflank pain", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1986_synpic26293"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1986_synpic26293", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1986_synpic26293.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Transverse", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Ct of the pelvic demonstrating a ureteral stone at the UVJ.", "age": "26", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "8.2", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nRight upper quadrant pain.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nN/A\n\nImaging Findings:\nUltrasound of the RUQ demonstrated a normal liver, common duct, and gall bladder.

Ninety per cent occur in children less than 7 years of age, with a median age of 3-1/2 years.  The children are usually asymptomatic, most often presenting with clinical suspicion of an abdominal mass (approximately 70%).  Other symptoms include abdominal pain (30%), hematuria (15 to 20%), and less commonly with moderately severe hypertension and nonspecific constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise, gastrointestinal complaints).  There is a higher incidence of Wilms' tumor in patients with certain congenital abnormalities such as aniridia, hemi-hypertrophy, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, nephroblastomatosis, and various genitourinary abnormalities (hypoplasia, fusion, ectopia, duplicated collecting systems, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism).\n\nWilms' tumor is secondary to proliferation of metanephric blastema.  It is typically bulky and usually extends within the renal parenchyma, displacing and distorting the pelvocalyceal system.  However, the mass may be exophytic or may, although rarely, be extrarenal.  The outcome following multimodal therapy depends on the initial stage and whether or not the tumor has favorable or unfavorable histology for response to treatment.  The unfavorable types include anaplastic, sarcomatous, and rhabdoid types.\n\nThe following stages have been described for Wilms' tumor:\n\nI:  Tumor limited to kidney and completely resected, negative margins, intact renal capsule, not rupture.\n\nII:  Tumor extends beyond kidney, but completely excised, negative margins, regional infiltration, spillage.\n\nIII:  Residual nonhematogenous tumor, confined to abdomen including lymph nodes, peritoneal implants, incomplete excision.\n\nIV:  Hematogenous metastases beyond stage III, i.e., lung, liver, bone, brain.\n\nV:  Bilateral renal involvement, at time of diagnosis.\n\nWilms' tumor is bilateral (Stage V) in 5 to 10% at time of initial diagnosis.  In a patient with unilateral Wilms', a contralateral tumor may develop 5 to 10 years later, although the majority occur within 2 years.  The work-up should include a plain abdominal supine radiograph, not only to look for mass affect but also to look for calcifications, skeletal abnormalities, and paravertebral masses which may help in differentiating Wilms' tumor from neuroblastoma. \n\nThe next imaging study should be abdominal and pelvic sonography to determine the organ of origin, the size and extent of the mass, the characteristics of the mass (solid, cystic, complex calcifications), the presence of regional lymphadenopathy, liver metastases, tumor thrombus in the renal vein, inferior vena cava, and/or right atrium, and to look for bilaterality of the mass.  One should also look for any evidence of nephroblastomatosis which appears sonographically as hypoechoic masses in the periphery of the kidney, thickening of the renal capsule, or as nodularity or lobulation of the kidney.  This entity, which may be an anlage for Wilms' tumor, is much more easily seen with contrast- enhanced CT.  Duplex and/or color Doppler imaging are particularly helpful in the evaluation of the venous vasculature structures that may be involved with Wilms' tumor.  Wilms' tumor is most often a solid mass, although cystic spaces may often be seen within the mass due to internal hemorrhage and/or necrosis.  We have noted that some of the cystic spaces within Wilms' tumor are large venous channels due to arteriovenous shunting.\n\nDepending upon the sophistication of the ultrasound, one may choose to also obtain a baseline CT, unless nephroblastomatosis is suspected.  Certainly a baseline chest CT is recommended prior to surgery to look for pulmonary metastases.  During and after their treatment, sonography is an excellent noninvasive means of following the children.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2584_synpic19853", "MPX2584_synpic19854", "MPX2584_synpic19855", "MPX2584_synpic19856"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2584_synpic19853", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2584_synpic19853.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Axial CT scan demonstrating bilateral low density round encapsulated lesions in the kidneys representing bilateral Wilms tumors.

HCC should be suspected in previously stable cirrhosis patients who experience a sudden deterioration in their condition.\n\nPhysical examination: The physician may find an enlarged and tender liver, palpable mass, and bruit or friction rub.\n\nLaboratory: A sudden and sustained elevation in AFP is suggestive of HCC.\n\nRadiographic evaluation:\n\n\tCT: HCC can present as a solitary mass, multiple masses with a dominant lesion and satellites or as a diffusely infiltrating neoplasm. The masses can be characterized as areas of low attenuation. Ten percent of tumors will show calcification. Dual phase imaging in arterial and portal venous phases may be necessary to detect the tumor. These tumors commonly invade blood vessels such as portal and hepatic veins. Portal vein thrombosis appears as regional wedge-like shapes of low density that project peripherally. Tumor thrombus will enhance on arterial phase CT images.\n\n\tMRI: MRI findings depend on the amount of fibrosis and necrosis in the liver. HCC can be recognized as low-signal intensity on T1 with an increase in signal intensity on T2.

The gas within the empyema was likely due to a bronchopleural fistula, secondary to either trauma from chest tube insertion or via necrosis of lung tissue. Alternatively, the gas may have come from one of the anaerobic microorganisms cultured from the purulent pleural fluid.", "topic_title": "Empyema", "acr_code": "6.2", "category": "Infection, generalized", "disease_discussion": "A parapneumonic effusion is any pleural effusion associated with suppurative parenchymal lung disease. Simple parapneumonic effusions are uninfected, free-flowing fluid collections. Complicated parapneumonic effusions are early infected fluid collections prone to develop loculations by fibrinous septations. Empyema is a collection of frank pus within the pleural space. An effusion is termed complex when it develops loculations. The natural evolution of untreated simple and complicated parapneumonic effusions is to become complex and to progress to frank empyema with development of a residual cavity or entrapment of the lung by a fibrous peel or cortex.\n\nPneumonia results in parapneumonic effusion in approximately 45% of cases, although less than 5% of these progress to an empyema. Other common causes include mediastinal or pulmonary surgery and trauma. Less frequently, empyema may result from spread of infection from adjacent structures. Mortality from empyema ranges from 1% to 20%. \n\nClinical manifestations vary, depending on the underlying pulmonary process, the responsible organism, the quantity of bacteria and fluid in the pleural space, the stage of the disease, and the host defense mechanisms. The clinical presentation can range from an absence of symptoms to a severe febrile illness with toxemia and shock. In general, it is difficult to distinguish patients with infected pleural effusions from those with sterile parapneumonic effusions on the basis of history and physical examination alone. Clinical manifestations include fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough with mucopurulent sputum. Physical examination often reveals decreased breath sounds, dull percussion, and restricted respiratory excursions. \n\nWith the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-1940s, a significant shift occurred in the microbiology of pleural space infections. Anaerobic organisms are now the most common bacteria isolated from infected pleural effusions, being identified in up to 75% of cases, either alone (35%) or in combination with aerobic organisms (40%). Up to 35% of established empyemas have negative Gram stain evaluations and many patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions have negative culture results. Staphylococcus aureus is a relatively common cause of empyema in otherwise healthy adults, children and in patients who have had chest trauma or prior surgery, whereas alcoholic males are particularly susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. \n\nThoracentesis plays a critical role in the management of pleural effusions and in 90% of adult cases yields useful information. Fluid is removed and samples obtained for measurement of pH, glucose, LDH, protein, and differential cell count. An exudate is defined by: (1) a ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein greater than 0.5, (2) a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH greater than 0.6, or (3) a pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds of the upper normal limit for serum or >200 IU [3] . A transudate does not meet any of the above three criteria. \n\nIf the patient has a transudative effusion, no further laboratory tests on the pleural fluid are indicated. If the patient has an exudative pleural effusion, the remaining pleural fluid is sent for WBC and differential, cytologic examination, Gram's stain and cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacteria and fungi if clinically indicated. The aspiration of frank pus confirms the presence of empyema and establishes an absolute indication for urgent drainage of the pleural space. In this instance, Gram's stain and culture are the only laboratory studies necessary to guide initial therapy. Pleural fluid Gram's stains can identify pathogens in 55% to 65% of patients with established empyemas. \nThe posterior-anterior and lateral chest radiographs are the best initial diagnostic modalities. When the patient is upright, free pleural fluid first accumulates in the lowest part of the hemithorax—the posterior costophrenic angles. Lateral decubitus views allow detection of 50 to 100 ml of fluid and the presence of loculations if the fluid fails to layer out along the dependent chest. In the view with the involved side superior, the free fluid layers against the mediastinum and one can assess how much of the radiodensity is due to the fluid and how much is due to a parenchymal infiltrate. In the view with the involved side dependent, the amount of free pleural fluid can be semi-quantitated by measuring the distance from the chest wall to the outside of the lung. If the thickness of fluid exceeds 10 mm, a diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated. However, it is not necessary to tap all parapneumonic effusions, especially if the volume of fluid remains small, the patient is doing well, the fluid moves freely, or serial roentgenograms show improvement. \n\nCT is of great value in the overall evaluation of parapneumonic effusions and should be done early in the assessment of patients with complex parapneumonic effusion or empyema. CT is helpful in (1) differentiating pleural fluid from peripheral parenchymal infiltrates or pleural thickening, (2) evaluating the parenchymal disease, (3) determining the presence of loculations, (4) characterizing the pleural surfaces, and (5) guiding and assessing therapy. Complicated effusions and empyemas are frequently associated with nearby pulmonary consolidation and can be mistaken for a lung abscess. A lung abscess usually presents as a poorly defined, roughly spherical mass surrounded by consolidated but non compressed lung. An empyema is usually elongated, conforms to the shape of the chest wall, and compresses the adjacent lung. Its wall is thin and uniform and the interface angle with the chest wall is obtuse. The margins of the empyema cavity are composed of inflamed visceral and parietal pleura that enhance after administration of intravenous contrast. The visceral and parietal layers are separated by the interposed empyema fluid, giving rise to the “split pleura sign”.\n\nUS is widely available, provides guidance for thoracentesis or pleural catheter placement, and can be transported to the bedside. US is particularly useful for sampling fluid that does not layer freely on decubitus films, and can distinguish solid from liquid pleural abnormalities better than chest roentgenography. The presence of discrete pleural septations has prognostic importance because loculated collections require drainage for their resolution. Computed tomography, however, gives additional information not obtained by US.\n\nThe sine qua non of empyema management is early, adequate, and dependent drainage. The therapeutic armamentarium for parapneumonic effusion or empyema consists of antibiotic therapy, thoracentesis, chest tube drainage, image-guided percutaneous catheter drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic agents, and a variety of surgical drainage procedures, including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy.", "keywords": "empyemaeffusionthoracentesis", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2263_synpic20905", "MPX2263_synpic20906"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2263_synpic20905", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2263_synpic20905.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Rim enhancement is seen and the split-pleura sign is demonstrated in the anterior-lateral and posterior-medial portions of the left hemi-thorax, indicating that the lesion is indeed an empyema.

These are carried by dogs, sheep and cattle.  The disease is rare in the United States, with only about 200 cases a year reported, mostly in the southwest and Alaska.  The disease is acquired as a child, with a latent period of 5 to 20 years  before signs or symptoms are noted.  The cysts continue to grow, eventually causing mechanical compression which leads to most symptoms.  Sixty percent of all these cysts are found in the liver, 25% in the lung, and 15% in the peritoneum, kidney, spleen, and retroperitoneum combined.  If the cysts of E. Granulosus rupture, they can cause an anaphylactoid reaction.  Theoretically, therefore, these masses should not be drained percutaneously.  In practice, however, some have been inadvertently punctured without complications.\n\nHydatid disease presents in four basic ultrasound patterns.  The first and most common is the cystic pattern, a round, anechoic, well-defined mass with smooth walls and posterior acoustic enhancement.  In 60% of cases, there is more than one parent cyst.  Some cysts may have septa dividing the cyst into numerous sections.  Occasionally the cysts may become infected.  With age, the cyst may collapse away from the edge of the cavity and may even fold in upon itself, forming what has been called the matrix.  This type of cyst cannot be differentiated from congenital cysts, traumatic cysts, or a cavitating tumor.  A second pattern, the racemose pattern,  has the parent cyst with daughter cysts (the pattern seen in this case).  The daughter cysts can be any number and appear round until they are so numerous that they become irregular and flat.  A third pattern consists of a solid mass that can be hypoechoic, hyperechoic, or isoechoic.  A fourth pattern presents with calcified walls.  Due to acoustic shadowing, a complete examination is often difficult.  However, by using different planes of section and varying the frequency and gain, the interior can usually be examined.  The interior is usually anechoic but may also be calcified.", "keywords": "liverechinococcosiscyst", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1746_synpic51005"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1746_synpic51005", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1746_synpic51005.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "There are two well-defined cysts with calcified rims in the posterior right hepatic lobe.

He remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged home the next day with no untoward effects.", "discussion": "Ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy using a spring loaded biopsy device is one of the most common methods used for renal biopsy (3). In a review of 1090 normotensive patients without coagulopathy who underwent the procedure between 1993 and 1997 the risk of post-biopsy minor hematoma formation was found to be 2.2% (3). More severe injuries such as loss of a kidney, life threatening hemorrhage, or persisting AV fistula have been reported but are considered exceedingly rare and did not occur in the study cited here. \n\nRenal injuries are typically classified in one of four radiologic categories (2):\n\nCategory I – Cortical Contusion; Subcapsular Hematoma; Minor Laceration with Mild Perinephric Hematoma; or Small Cortical Infarct (2).\n\nCategory II – Major Laceration with medullary involvement; Segmental Infarct (2). \n\nCategory III-  Multiple Renal Lacerations; Vascular Pedicle Injury (2).\n\nCategory IV-  UPJ Injury (2)\n\nIn evaluating a suspected renal injury, CT is the primary modality relied upon to detect and characterize a lesion (2). Using contrast enhanced CT, a renal injury such as a hematoma or laceration can be evaluated and the presence of active hemorrhage or urinary extravasation can frequently be documented (2).\n\nSubcapsular hematomas appear on CT imaging as a crescenteric enlargement surrounding all or a portion of the renal cortex (1). The density of these lesions varies depending upon injury maturity; hyperattenuating in earlier stages and becoming more hypoattenuating with time (1). Slight mass affect on the adjacent renal cortex may also be recognized (1). When the renal capsule is injured whether by blunt trauma or penetrating injury (as in this case by means of a biopsy needle), hematoma can enter the perinephric space (1). Hemorrhage in the perinephric space, when limited, appears similar to the subcapsular hematoma but demonstrates more ragged and heterogeneous margins.   \n\nMost subcapsular hematomas are managed conservatively (1). Only life threatening hemorrhage and impending circulatory collapse will prompt surgical exploration (1). \n\nThis patient was admitted to the hospital over night for close observation, following which he was discharged home with no untoward effects. \n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

The lesion is typically subcentimeter, unifocal, and causes pain that is worst at night and relieved within 20-25 minutes of taking aspirin.  It can occur virtually anywhere in the skeleton, but most commonly appears in the femoral neck, tibial midshaft, and diaphysis of other long bones. Rarely, osteoid osteomas occur in the bones of the face.    Patients are usually between 10 and 35 years old.\n\nConventional radiography and CT imaging typically reveal a benign-appearing, cortical, medullary, or subperiosteal radiolucency surrounded by a well-defined zone of sclerosis.  Often, a radiodense nidus is seen centrally.  90% of osteoid osteomas show intense focal uptake on bone scan.  CT is becoming the diagnostic modality of choice, as its capacity for excellent bony detail easily demonstrates the characteristic sclerotic nidus within the sclerotic-rimmed lucency, and allows precise location of the lesion.  MRI may define a nidus that remains unapparent on CT or scintigraphy, but is not generally employed.\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes stress fracture, cortical abcess, and intracortical osteosarcoma in cortical lesions; Brodie's abcess, bone island, and osteoblastoma in medullary lesions.  The characteristic appearance of osteoid osteoma often is enough to confirm the diagnosis.  Osteoid osteomas lack the lucent lines of stress fractures, the lucent tracts of abcesses, the bulging cortical disruptions of osteosarcoma, the periosteal reaction of osteoblastoma, and the normal bone scan and “brush” trabecular borders of bone islands.  Intense focal uptake on bone scan may confirm the diagnosis.  \n\nThese lesions are treated by either curettage or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, often with CT or gamma camera guidance.

This anomaly presents either unilaterally or bilaterally, and is estimated to occur in up to fifteen percent of the population.  Most individuals with a duplicated renal collecting system remain asymptomatic with their anomaly being found incidentally on imaging studies.  Those patients who become symptomatic with their duplicated collecting system generally have two distinct and complete urters, and are prone to developing obstruction, reflux, and infection.\n     A duplicated renal collecing system forms by one of two ways.  The first results from the embryologic bifurcation of a single ureteral bud prior to the bifurcation of the ampulla, and produces either a bifid ureteral pelvis or a bifid ureter which joins distally prior to bladder insertion.  The second results when two distinct embryologic ureteral buds arise from the Wolffian duct, giving rise to two complete and separate ureters which insert separately into the bladder.  In this second case, with two separate ureters, the upper pole ureter drains below and medial to the lower pole ureter at its insertion.  According to the Weigert-Meyer rule, the upper pole ureter is prone to obstruction and hydronephrosis as well as ureterocele formation, while the lower pole ureter is prone to refulx and at is risk for pyleonephritis.

The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is unreliable. Symptoms of PE include tachypnea/dyspnea (most common), tachycardia, hypoxia, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, syncope, and atrial fibrillation. Blood gas may be normal. \n\nThe D-dimer blood test is a screening tool for pulmonary embolism. A serum level less than 500 ng/L excludes pulmonary embolism with a 90% accuracy. A positive test is non-specific. Additionally, the test is unreliable in the presence of malignancy, sepsis, recent surgery, or trauma. \n\nThe source is  most commonly from deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity,  however, about 10% arise from clot in the upper extremity.  Risk factors are  Immobilization, Recent Surgery, Underlying Malignancy, History of Deep Venous Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism, Estrogen use, or Pre-existing cardiac disease. A low percentage of cases of pulmonary embolism result in pulmonary infarction, due to the presence of the bronchial circulation. \n\nTreatment for PE most commonly consists of anticoagulation with heparin or coumadin. Anticoagulation prevents clot propagation and allows endogenous fibrinolytic activity to dissolve existing thrombiAnticoagulation decreases mortality form 30-60% to <5%.  \nThrombolytic agents are not routinely used for the treatment of acute PE. Thrombolytic treatment is generally reserved for patients with massive pulmonary embolism producing circulatory shock (hypotension).\n\nFor patients that cannot be anticoagulated, an inferior vena caval filter can be placed in order to prevent life-threatening PE. Major complications occur in about 1% of cases. Complications include central migration of the filter, filter fracture, inferior vena caval perforation, and vena caval thrombosis.\nV/Q scanning has been the mainstay for screening symptomatic patients for the presence of pulmonary embolism. A negative V/Q scan essentially excludes PE, and a high probability study is associated with the presence of a PE in about 85% of cases at angiography. Confusion arises with low or intermediate probability examinations, and there is common disagreement among expert readers in the interpretation of scans in these categories. The problem with V/Q scanning is that it does not directly visualize thromboembolism, but rather its effects on perfusion and ventilation . This problem causes the need for probability criteria, which in turn causes confusing results.  Nuclear medicine scanning for PE is probably most useful in previously healthy patients with a normal chest radiograph.   As the complexity of the patients underlying cardiopulmonary disease increases, so does the likelihood that the scan will not be informative (intermediate probability). Using PIOPED criteria, intermediate probability V/Q scans occurred in 60% of patients with COPD, but in only 13% of patients with normal CXR's. However, a generalized abnormality on CXR such as diffuse pulmonary edema or reticulonodular disease may not cause the perfusion lung scan to be abnormal.\n\nThe CXR is abnormal in the majority of cases of PE. The PIOPED study showed that among patients with angiographically proven pulmonary embolism, only 12% had chest X-rays interpreted as normal.  (24% of patients with PE in another study had normal CXR's ). Atelectasis and other focal pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are the most common CXR findings in pulmonary embolism, occurring in up to 68% of patients with PE.  Pleural effusions are also common but usually small and  unilateral. Other palin film findings indicative of PE include regional oligemia (Westermark sign), a pleural-based wedge shaped area of increased opacity (Hampton's hump), and prominence of the central pulmonary artery with abrupt tapering (Knuckle sign).\n\nIn pulmonary angiography,an embolus classiclally produces a filling defect within the affected pulmonary artery. Non-occlusive emboli have a \"tram-track\" appearance. Although considered the gold standard, angiography may not always detect the presence of emboli. Some indirect angiographic evidence for the presence of emboli such as vascular pruning and delayed capillary blush are non-specific. Additionally, agreement among angiographers regarding the presence of subsegmental emboli is poor  and can be as low as 15%. V/Q scans can provide a road map to angiography, but if the abnormally perfused segment on the V/Q scan appears normal at angiography, complete evaluation the remainder of the lungs for the presence of pulmonary emboli is warranted. One important point to remember is that a negative angiogram has been shown to be an excellent indicator of a good prognosis. \n\nHelical CT is able to identify main, lobar, and segmental emboli with a reported sensitivity over 90%. Although the detection of subsegmental emboli is worse, the clinical significance of these small emboli has not yet been establishished. Additionally, on angiography there is poor interobserver agreement for the presence of subsegmental emboli  and the true incidence of isolated subsegmental emboli is difficult to determine. Helical CT has also been shown to have a significantly better sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values compared to V/Q scanning . Helical CT permits a more confident diagnosis to be made in a greater number of cases when compared with V/Q scanning . \n\nIt has been suggested that helical or electron beam CT should be the initial imaging modality to screen patients suspected of having PE- particularly in patients with abnormal CXR's in whom there is a greater likelihood of inconclusive V/Q scan results. If emboli are detected, no further work-up is required. If this study is negative, a lower extremity US or CT DVT exam can be performed to assess for the presence of DVT. Again, a positive exam would lead to patient treatment. If both studies were negative, then a decision would be required regarding whether the patient should proceed to angiography or not.  Another benefit of CT is the ability to suggest an alternative diagnosis.", "keywords": "Pulmonay embolismv/q scanhelical ct", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1058_synpic17148"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1058_synpic17148", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1058_synpic17148.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Large filling defect draped at main pulmonary artery bifurcation.\n\nFilling defect in RLL branch pulmonary artery. \n\nNon loculated right pleural effusion.", "age": "78", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "5.6", "figure_part": "4"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nComplains of several days of vague abdominal pain, general weakness and shortness of breath.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nDecreased breath sounds to right lower lobe. \nElevated ESR.\nNormocytic anemia.\n\nImaging Findings:\nBilateral pleural effusions, R>>L.

The gastroduodenal artery branches off the common hepatic artery posterior and superior to the duodenum. The common hepatic artery then continues as the proper hepatic artery and turns upward to ascend in the hepatoduodenal ligament, in front of the epiploic (Winslow's) foramen.

If the arteries arise entirely from some source other than the celiac arterial distribution, they are called replaced arteries and can supply an entire lobe of the liver or even the entire liver. Atypical hepatic arteries are commonly called accessory arteries if they arise from some aberrant source and are additive to lobar branches.

Contrast-enhanced MRI is very sensitive for tumors and may disclose minute lesions). This patient should be followed by neurology on a routine basis.  Any new onset in local or radiating pain, progressive weakness in the arms or legs, loss of balance and impaired bowel or bladder function should initiate a complete neurologic workup. Examination may reveal a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs. Lower motor signs may be at the level of the lesion and may aid in localization.  Other signs upon physical examination may include spine tenderness, stiffening of gait, trophic changes of extremities or sensory loss.

(each subset is briefly described below). The location of the soft tissue mass-like lesion in this patient is representative of an intradural-extramedullary tumor (ie. neurofibroma, meningioma or schwannoma- see discussion below).\n\nExtradural tumors:  usually metastatic and most often arise in the vertebral bodies. Metastatic lesions can cause spinal cord compression either by intradural invasion or, more commonly, by epidural growth that results in extrinsic spinal cord or cauda equina compression. \n\nIntradural-extramedullaryTumors: arise within the dura, but outside the actual spinal cord. They are usually nerve sheath tumors or meningiomas. \n\nIntramedullary Tumors: arise within the spinal cord itself.  The majority are gliomas, either astrocytomas or ependymomas, although metastases are recognized with increasing frequency. Although most spinal tumors are extradural, most primary spinal malignancies are intradural. The thoracic, lumbosacral, and cervical spinal canal is involved in 50, 30, and 20 percent of cases, respectively. \n\nIntradural-extramedullary Tumors:\nMeningiomas can arise from arachnoidal cells anywhere along the neuraxis and are occasionally found in association with neurofibromatosis.  Approximately 90 percent of the tumors occur within the cranial fossa and the majority of spinal meningiomas occur within the thoracic spine (of note: this patient has a prior hx of intracranial meningioma). The tumors are frequently adherent to the spinal dura, requiring dural resection for complete removal, and also grow along intradural and extradural components of the nerve roots. Spinal meningiomas are typically slowly growing invasive lesions and often erode bone. Rarely, the tumors may be considered malignant or aggressive if they demonstrate a proclivity to recur. The usual treatment for spinal meningiomas is resection; complete resection can often be achieved. The dural origin is generally cauterized and occasionally resected. Thoracic spinal roots may be sacrificed as necessary to obtain a complete resection; however, cervical and lumbar roots are preserved whenever possible. Subtotally resected lesions are generally followed expectantly for regrowth. Symptomatic recurrences are generally treated with further surgery.\nSchwannomas are generally benign lesions that arise from schwann cells that normally produce the myelin coverings of nerve roots. These lesions are slow growing and cause compression of nerve roots and other neural elements. The tumors can be intradural or extradural in location and are often dumbbell-shaped. Their biologic behavior is similar to neurofibromas (see below) but they do not, as a rule, invade the nerve. Schwannomas are generally encapsulated and may have both an extradural and intradural component and cause widening the neural foramina. Treatment consists of tumor resection, though sacrificing the nerve to ensure complete removal may be required. Additionally, complete resection may require removal of the facet joints and reconstruction of the spine may be necessary. \nNeurofibromas are biologically similar to schwannomas but the incidence is lower, except in patients with neurofibromatosis (see below). The tumors usually develop along peripheral or cranial nerves and are a central feature of neurofibromatosis 1, where they may occur intracranially or involve several spinal roots.  Involvement of peripheral nerves is manifest as firm, rubbery, subcutaneous lesions. Tumors found in association with the spinal nerve roots (as seen in this patient) are grossly similar in appearance to schwannomas. Nerve dysfunction may be caused by fusiform enlargement of the nerve with encasement of the axons by fibrous strands. Neurofibromas can be identified easily with MR imaging. The lesions are ovoid in appearance and increase in intensity with the administration of contrast material. CT myelography may demonstrate focal epidural compression at the involved site, and further delineate the tumor extent. The treatment for symptomatic neurofibromas is surgical resection. However, because there is usually no clear plane between the tumor and the nerve it is impossible to remove the tumor without sacrificing the involved nerve. The prognosis is good for the removal of a single neurofibroma. In cases of neurofibromatosis, the prognosis is poorer because of the multiplicity of lesions and the possibility that one of the lesions will undergo malignant transformation. \nNeurofibromatosis is an inherited disorder and is divided into two types. Neurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen’s disease) is characterized cutaneous neurofibromas, pigmented lesions of the skin called caf? au lait spots, freckling in non-sun exposed areas such as the axilla, hamartomas of the iris termed Lisch nodules, and pseudoarthrosis of the tibia. It is associated with a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17 that codes for the protein, rofibromin, which modulates signal transduction through the ras GTPase pathway. Patients with NF1 are at increased risk of developing nervous system gliomas, ependymomas, meningiomas, astrocytomas and pheochromocytomas. Neurofibromas may undergoe secondary malignant degeneration and become sarcomas. Neurofibromatosis 2 is sometimes called central neurofibromatosis. It is caused by a gene on chromosome 22. Bilateral schwannomas of the acoustic nerve and multiple meningiomas are characteristic.", "keywords": "Neurofibroma, likely neurofibromatosis type I.neurofibromatosis type I", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2275_synpic24623"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2275_synpic24623", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2275_synpic24623.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "CT Chest W/O Contrast-  Significant amount of calcification involving the coronary vessels, aorta, and splenic artery.

Radionuclide study; CT; MRI; and, occasionally, angiography are complementary examinations. Any or all may be used to arrive at a diagnosis.  The ribs show lytic expansile lesions, which may be associated with pathologic fractures.  Lesions are lytic, round or oval, and expansile, with ill-defined or sclerotic margins.  The medullary cavity may be expanded and associated with cortical thinning, intracortical tunneling, and erosion of the cortex and an adjacent soft-tissue mass.  Laminated periosteal new bone formation is common around the involved segment of bone.\n\t CT scans may be particularly useful in osseous lesions in areas with complex anatomy, such as the mastoids, atlantoaxial joints, and posterior elements of the vertebral bodies. Also, soft tissue components are better depicted on CT scans than on other images. The destruction of the mastoid, petrous ridge, tegmen tympani, and lateral sinus plate and the destruction of the inner and external ear are depicted elegantly on CT scans. CT may demonstrate an isoattenuating and homogeneously enhancing mass in the hypothalamus/pituitary gland.  CT is considerably better than plain radiography and conventional tomography in depicting an intracranial extension of EG.   CT appearances of EG are nonspecific, and a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic processes may mimic EG.\n\tOn spin-echo MRIs, osseous lesions of EG reveal decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted and high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. The lesion may enhance after the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent.  The value of using MRI to image patients with EG lies in the sensitivity of MRI because its specificity is low. However, the cost of the procedure and the procedural problems encountered in imaging young children confer no advantages over plain radiography.  The soft tissue component around the osseous lesion has poor definition and shows signal inhomogeneity, which may mimic that of a malignant tumor, infection, or stress fracture.", "topic_title": "Eosinophilic granuloma", "acr_code": "471.663", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "-Factoid Discussion:\n\n  The hallmark of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) in most patients is an osseous lesion.  When the bone is the only organ involved, the disease is referred to as eosinophilic granuloma.  EG is the benign form of the 3 clinical variants of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which include Litterer-Siwe disease, Hand Schuller-Christian disease, and EG (formerly termed histiocytosis X).  When more organs are affected, causing cranial lesions, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos, it is refered to a Hand-Schuller-Christian disease.  The disseminated form of LCH, called Litterer-Siwe disease, is more often seen in infants and children who are less than 3 years old and is characterized by wasting, hepatosplenomegally, generalized lymphadenopathy, skin rash, generalized multiple lesions, and sometimes pancytopenia.\nEG is characterized by a single or multiple skeletal lesions, and it predominantly affects children, adolescents, or young adults.  Solitary lesions are more common that multiple lesions.  When multiple lesions occur, the new osseous lesions appear within 1-2 years.  Any bone and be involved, but the most common sites include the skull, mandible, spine, ribs, and long bones.\n\n-Etiology and Pathogenesis: \n\n  EG is a benign disorder that affects children and young adults, particularly males.  The solitary bone lesion may be asymptomatic, or it may cause bone pain because of expansion of the medullary bone.  Pathologic fractures may ensue. The pathogenesis of LCH is unknown.  An ongoing debate exists over whether this is a reactive or neoplastic process.  Arguments supporting the reactive nature of this disorder include the occurrence of spontaneous remissions, the failure to detect aneuploidy, metaphase or karyotypic abnormalities, and the good survival rate in patients without organ dysfunction. On the other hand, the infiltration of organs by aberrant cells, a possible lethal evolution, and the cancer-based modalities of successful treatment are all consistent with a neoplastic process. In addition, the demonstration of LCH as a monoclonal proliferation by X chromosome-linked DNA probes supports a neoplastic origin for this proliferation; however, the presence of this finding in distinct subtypes with different evolutions demands further investigations to evaluate its significance. \nThere is evidence for a role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of LCH by the creation of a permissive immunosurveillance system. Abnormalities of suppressor cell number and function have been documented in several reports. Increased levels of messenger RNA for macrophage colony stimulating factor and platelet derived growth factor have been detected in cells from a pulmonary LCH lesion.\n\n-Epidemiology:\n  LCH is a rare disease. Estimated annual incidence ranges from 0.5-5.4 per million persons per year. Approximately 1200 new cases per year are reported in the United States.   More than half of the patients younger than 2 years, with disseminated LCH and organ dysfunction die of the disease; whereas, unifocal LCH and the majority of cases of congenital self-healing histiocytosis, are self-limited. Multifocal chronic LCH is self-limited in most cases, though increased mortality has been observed among infants with pulmonary involvement.  Prevalence of LCH seems to be higher among whites.  Incidence of LCH is greater in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 2:1).   LCH affects patients from neonates to adults. Age of onset varies according to the variety of LCH. Letterer-Siwe disease occurs predominantly in children younger than 2 years. The chronic multifocal form, including the Hand-Schuller-Christian syndrome, has a peak of onset between 2-10 years of age. Localized eosinophilic granuloma occurs mostly frequently in those aged 5-15 years.\n\n-Clinical Manifestations:\n  Most patients have no symptoms, and the diagnosis is usually based on radiographic demonstration of a destructive bone lesion arising from the marrow cavity and on characteristic morphologic findings. Localized bone pain and focal tenderness may occur as a result of bone erosion and, rarely, a pathologic fracture. A swelling or mass may be palpable at the site of osseous involvement. Rarely, children may present with fever and leukocytosis. Involvement of the mastoid process involvement may appear with intractable otitis media with a chronic discharge. Mandibular involvement may present with gingival and continuous soft-tissue swelling.\n\n- Diagnosis:\n  Definite diagnosis is based on biopsy.  Because of the absence of distinctive morphologic characteristics of the LCH cell, special studies are used to identify the cell. The Birbeck granule is the distinctive ultrastructural hallmark of the LC. It consists of an intracytoplasmic membranous body, 33 nm wide and 190-360 nm long, possessing a short, rodlike shape with a dotted line down the midline of the space between the membranes (resembling a zipper) and a terminal expansion in the form of a vesicle giving a \"racquet\" appearance. Although these granules are resistant to destruction by formalin fixation and paraffin embedding, the sensitivity of detection in such specimens is slightly decreased. Birbeck granules are rarely detected in lesions of the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and spleen. Langerhans cells also contain laminated substructures of lysosomes, tuboreticular structures, and trilaminar membranous loops.  \nThe Writing Group of the Histiocyte Society (1987) has proposed 3 levels of certainty in the diagnosis of LCH based on the clinical features, histopathology, and special immunohistochemical techniques. A presumptive diagnosis is based on a typical clinical presentation and light microscopic findings. A designated diagnosis includes light microscopy in combination with positive S-100 and PNA staining studies. To make a definitive diagnosis, identification of Birbeck granules and CD1a antigens is required.\n\n-Treatment:\n  Solitary bone lesions are treated locally with curettage or excision.  Painful bone lesions may require intralesional steroid injection (triamcinolone acetonide).  Polyostotic bone lesions are best treated with indomethacin or a short course of systemic steroids.  Rarely, lesions that are unusually large and painful occur in inaccessible sites or involve vital structures. They require radiation (3-6 Gy [300-600 rads]).", "keywords": "EGLangerhans cell histiocytosishistiocytosis X", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1750_synpic18372", "MPX1750_synpic18487", "MPX1750_synpic18488", "MPX1750_synpic18490"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1750_synpic18372", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1750_synpic18372.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A non-contrast axial CT image of the chest in Bone window demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.", "age": "23", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "471.663", "figure_part": "2e"}, {"image_id": "MPX1750_synpic18487", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1750_synpic18487.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A non-contrast axial CT image of the chest in Bone window demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.", "age": "23", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "471.663", "figure_part": "2a"}, {"image_id": "MPX1750_synpic18488", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1750_synpic18488.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A non-contrast axial CT image of the chest in Bone window demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.", "age": "23", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "471.663", "figure_part": "2b"}, {"image_id": "MPX1750_synpic18490", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1750_synpic18490.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A non-contrast axial CT image of the chest in Bone window demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.", "age": "23", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "471.663", "figure_part": "2d"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n23 y/o female with 6-week history of right sided chest pain.

Current recommendations are based on numerous studies, such as the PIOPED study.  Imaging modalities vary and can be situation or institution dependent.  The initial work-up for a pt suspected of having a pulmonary embolism involves a CXR in order to rule out other pulmonary or cardiac findings, such as a pneumothorax, pneumonia, or rib fracture.  If the CXR is non diagnostic, other imaging modalities include V/Q scan, helical CT with PE protocol, pulmonary angiography, echocardiography, or venous US of the lower extremities.  The gold standard is generally thought to be pulmonary angiography.      There are advantages and disadvantages to each modality.  CXR is rarely diagnostic of PE, nor does it often show the classic findings (Hampton’s hump, Westermark’s sign).  However, it can be useful for ruling out other pathology.  The most common findings on CXR in pt’s with PE include atelectasis, pleural effusions, infiltrates, and elevation of the hemidaphragm.      V/Q scans also are rarely diagnostic.   The scans can be difficult to interpret and often meaningless if there is other underlying pulmonary pathology.  Additionally, the diagnosis of PE was highly dependent on the clinical suspicion of the physician.           More recently, helical CT has been used to aid in diagnosing PE.  Disadvantages include poor visualization of the periphery of the lungs at the subsegmental level.  The main advantage is the relative ease of the procedure and the decreased variable of reader interpretation (when compared to V/Q scans).      As previously stated, pulmonary angiography continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary emboli.

In a patient of this age and with his history of atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis, left atrial thrombus and infective endocarditis were high on the differential for the embolic source.\n\nThe patient underwent two transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) evaluating for possible endocarditis. Both TTEs were negative for atrial thrombus, and neither could effectively image the aortic valve due to the high level of valvular calcification present. It should be noted that TTE has a relatively low sensitivity (high false negative rate) for visualizing left atrial appendage thrombi compared to TEE and cardiac-gated CT.\n\nA transesophageal echocardiogram was bypassed after the patient was deemed not to be a good surgical candidate (based on age and comorbidities); this cardiac-gated CT scan was later performed instead to evaluate for the embolic source. The CT scan showed no evidence of infective endocarditis, but did reveal a filling defect within the left atrial appendage. Of note, single-phase contrast imaging with cardiac-gated CT can have a falsely positive filling defect in the left atrial appendage, especially in cases of atrial fibrillation when the atria may be dilated and/or there is little contractility to allow adequate contrast mixing within the appendage. Key to this study is the late-phase imaging, which showed contrast filling the atrial appendage and highlighting the presence of a thrombus. This finding was pathognomonic. \n\nCardiac tumors, including atrial myxomas and papillary fibroelastomas (as well as metastatic disease), are other possibilities, but are considerably more rare; thus, they remain low on the differential diagnosis.", "topic_title": "Left atrial appendage thrombus", "acr_code": "5.7", "category": "Vascular", "disease_discussion": "The three classic mechanisms for thrombus formation include blood flow stasis, blood vessel wall damage, and a hypercoagulable state. All three of these are thought to contribute to the development of thrombi in patients with atrial fibrillation. This has considerable clinical relevance, with atrial fibrillation being a major cause of thromboembolic disease leading to serious morbidity and mortality.\n\nWhile thrombus formation is possible anywhere within the heart depending on variations in anatomy and function of the atria, ventricles and valves, the left atrial appendage is of particular interest. Low blood velocities in the atrial appendage result in high incidences of thrombus formation compared to elsewhere in the heart. Roughly 90% of thrombi in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation arise in, or associated with, the left atrial appendage. It is thought that the anatomy of the appendage, with its relatively small communication to the left atrium and the presence of trabeculations, predisposes the area to low blood flow. In patients with atrial fibrillation, atrial contractile function decreases significantly, and there is relative blood stasis in the appendage leading to thrombus formation.\n\nTraditionally, the left atrial appendage has been best evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE); while more invasive than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), TEE was found to be much more effective at visualizing thrombi in the atria and the left atrial appendage. More recently, cardiac-gated computed tomography (CT) angiography has been shown to have thrombus detection values very similar to that of TEE (sensitivity and specificity values near 100%). Cardiac-gated CT may become the preferred modality for evaluation of suspected thromboembolic disease from a cardiac source in cases where TEE is not tolerated or non-diagnostic.\n\nThrombus formation in patients with atrial fibrillation is counteracted in the majority of moderate to high risk patients with warfarin therapy. However, a sizable proportion of patients are unable to take oral anticoagulation therapy due to contraindications or are non-compliant. For this reason, there are techniques used to close the left atrial appendage, either in an open approach during surgery (for valve replacement, for example) or, more recently, with percutaneous devices. Long term outcome studies are still pending, however, left atrial appendage occlusion may become a viable method for stroke prevention in patients unable to take oral anticoagulants.", "keywords": "atrial appendagethromboembolismatrial fibrillation", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1663_synpic51009", "MPX1663_synpic51013", "MPX1663_synpic51015"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1663_synpic51009", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1663_synpic51009.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Early phase cardiac gated CT w/ contrast: Filling defect within the left atrial appendage.", "age": "80", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "5.7", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1663_synpic51013", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1663_synpic51013.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Calcific stenosis of the aortic valve.", "age": "80", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "5.7", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1663_synpic51015", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1663_synpic51015.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Late-phase image: Thrombus within the left atrial appendage.", "age": "80", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "5.7", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n80 year-old man with a known history of rate-controlled atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis presented one week prior to study with facial droop.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nLeft sided facial droop with noted drooling.\n\nINR 1.3\n\nImaging Findings:\n•  There is a low-attenuating mass in the left atrial appendage.

Along the way, it gives rise to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, several jejunal and ileal branches, the middle colic artery, and the right colic artery.  Complete or partial occlusion of the SMA leads to acute mesenteric ischemia, with a mortality rate of 60-70%.   There are four major causes of acute mesenteric ischemia: 1) SMA embolism (50%); 2) SMA thrombosis (15-25%); 3) Mesenteric venous thrombosis (5%); 4) Nonocclusive ischemia (20 to 30 percent). ,   The SMA is particularly susceptible to embolic events of cardiac origin, due to it’s relatively large caliber, and narrow take-off angle from the descending aorta.   The embolus usually lodges 3 to 10 cm distal to the origin of the SMA, in a tapered segment distal to the take off of the middle colic artery.  In general, the clinical presentation of acute mesenteric ischemia is limited to sudden onset of pain, pain out of proportion to physical findings, and possibly some nausea and/or vomiting.  The laboratory findings are non-specific.  Radiographically, mesenteric angiography remains the gold standard diagnostic study for mesenteric arterial ischemia.  Plain fim radiography of the abdomen is non-specific, and in 25% of all cases, will be normal.   The use of traditional CT (with contrast) for the detection of mesenteric ischemia is limited by the ability of the radiologist to distinguish areas of decreased opacity distal to site of obstruction.  One small study demonstrated a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 92%.     MRA and Multi detector row CT (MDCT) hold promise as viable tools to evaluate mesenteric arteries, however no comparison studies are available for study.  Angiography therefore remains the gold standard.Treatment of mesenteric arterial embolism, traditionally, has been early surgical laparotomy with embolectomy.  Intra-operative palpation for SMA pulses is performed and the small bowel is carefully examined for areas of persistent ischemia, which are resected.  A \"second look\" laparotomy within the next 24 to 48 hours may be necessary to resect additional ischemic or gangrenous bowel.  A less well-established approach (which was used initially in this case) is local infusion of thrombolytic therapy, which has been successful in a number of reports. , ,  Thrombolytic therapy should only be considered in patients who can undergo angiography within eight hours of the onset of abdominal pain, and who do not have clinical evidence of bowel necrosis or other contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.  Surgical exploration is mandatory in patients who do not demonstrate clot lysis within four hours or develop evidence of progressive ischemia. Despite success in case series, the long-term reocclusion rate after thrombolytic therapy has not been well studied.

It is composed of variable amounts of fat and hematopoietic tissue, including myeloid and erythroid cells and megakaryocytes.  The imaging appearance is based on the fat content of this lesion.  Thus they appear echogenic on US, low attenuation on CT and hyperintense on T1 weighted in phase MR images. The etiology is unclear, but myelolipoma may be a result of metaplasia of cells in the adrenal, possibly myeloid cells misplaced during embryogenesis. It affects men and women equally. Although this is a nonfunctioning tumor, in 10% it is associated with endocrine disorders, including Cushing syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Conn syndrome. Most myelolipomas (80%) are asymptomatic and are of no clinical significance. Some (10%) become large and cause vague symptoms or pain. Large myelolipomas may hemorrhage, which can be the cause of pain. Size ranges from 1 to 15 cm, with a mean of about 4 cm. \n\nOn CT, most myelolipomas are well-circumscribed masses. Nearly all contain some definite fat density (<-20 HU). However, the amount of fat is widely variable, ranging from nearly all fat, to more than half fat (50%), to only a few tiny foci of fat in a soft-tissue mass (10%).  Occasionally, the mass has an attenuation value between that of fat and water because the fat and myeloid elements are diffusely mixed. Calcification is seen in 30%, often punctate. With hemorrhage, high density areas can be seen. Bilateral myelolipomas occur in about 10%. \n\nThe presence of fat in an adrenal mass is the key to the diagnosis of myelolipoma, because virtually no other adrenal lesion contains fat. Teratoma and liposarcoma of the adrenals are extraordinarily rare.  Macroscopic fat on CT (HU= -30 to -110), usually obviates the need for biopsy, but if necessary (i.e. extra-adrenal location which may then mimic a liposarcoma), diagnosis can be confirmed by percutaneous needle sampling. A definite diagnosis is important because surgical resection is not indicated unless there has been significant hemorrhage.

Cholangiocarcinomas are encountered in 3 geographic regions: intrahepatic, extrahepatic (ie, perihilar), and distal extrahepatic. Perihilar tumors are the most common and intrahepatic tumors are the least common. Perihilar tumors also called Klatskin tumors occur at the bifurcation of right and left hepatic ducts. 95% of these tumors are ductal adenocarcinomas and the remainder are squamous cell tumors. Local extension occurs into the liver, porta hepatis, and regional lymph nodes of the celiac and pancreaticoduodenal chains. The etiology of most bile duct cancers remains undetermined. Long-standing inflammation, as with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or chronic parasitic infection, has been suggested as playing a role by inducing hyperplasia, cellular proliferation, and, ultimately, malignant transformation. Cholangiocarcinomas is slow growing and tends to invade locally dissecting along tissue planes. In Southeast Asia, chronic infection with liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis has been causally related to cholangiocarcinomas. It also has an association with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.  Increased incidence has been noted in exposure to Thortrast radiopaque medium and in rubber industries. Several congenital diseases also show a relationship, including choledochal cysts and Caroli’s disease. \n\n•  Clinical presentation:\nPatients often present with painless jaundice and many patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease.  Pruritis and non-specific abdominal pain are other common complaints. Physical exam findings include hepatomegaly (tender/non-tender), a palpable non-tender gallbladder (Courvoisier sign) and splenomegaly secondary to portal hypertension. Lab findings include elevated LFT’s.  CEA and CA 19-9 tumor markers may be positive but cholangiocarcinomas does not produce alpha feto proteins (AFP).\n\n• Imaging:\nInitial evaluation should be with ultrasound and CT.  The most common US finding is general ductal dilitation.  Focal ductal dilitation, lobar atrophy, bile duct wall thickening and rarely a polypoid mass within the ducts may also be seen.  CT demonstrates biliary dilation as well but can show thickening of the bile duct walls more accurately. In peripheral cholangiocarcinomas the CT scan is often nonspecific demonstrating minimal contrast enhancement with a poorly defined isoattenuating or hypoattenuating mass.  Delayed enhancement (8-10 min) is useful in hilar tumors.  The tumor itself is only identified in about 50% of cases.  CT is good at showing lymphadenopathy and lobar atrophy.  Cholangiography(ERCP or PTC) is very helpful in demonstrating ductal anatomy and has the added benefit of enabling stent placement for drainage. MRI Cholangiography is being used more frequently and may help define tumor extension into portal vessels.\n\n•  Treatment:\nStenting is very useful in both palliative care to relieve obstruction and for symptomatic relief preop.  The only possible cure is complete resection but imaging confirmation of complete resection is often impossible. Lesions are considered unresectable if tumor involves either both lobes of the liver or major portal veins or hepatic arteries. Overall resecatability is about 40%. Chemo and radiation therapy can be used for palliative treatment but show little benefit. Celiac-plexus block via regional injection of alcohol or other sclerosing agent can relieve pain in the mid-back associated with retroperitoneal tumor growth.", "keywords": "cholangiocarcinomaklatskindilated bile ducts", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1381_synpic17620", "MPX1381_synpic17621", "MPX1381_synpic17622", "MPX1381_synpic17623"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1381_synpic17620", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1381_synpic17620.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Abdomen", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Arterial Phase.\n\n- hetrogeneous enhancement at margins  of lesion.", "age": "84", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "7.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1381_synpic17621", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1381_synpic17621.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Abdomen", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Portal Venous Phase.\n\n- Isoattenuating lesion periphery with hypoattenuating ?necrotic center. \n\n- Ill-defined margins.", "age": "84", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "7.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1381_synpic17622", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1381_synpic17622.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Abdomen", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Delayed Image.\n\n- 25 min later the lesions shows continuos homogeneous enhancement of its margins and persistent non-enhancing hypodense center.", "age": "84", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "7.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1381_synpic17623", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1381_synpic17623.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Abdomen", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Arterial phase contrast", "age": "84", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "7.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n84 year old white male with vague RUQ abdominal pain and elevated CA 19-9 marker.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nRUQ Tenderness.\n• CA 19-9: 514 (0-36)\n• AST: 32\n• ALT: 53\n• Alk Phos: 118\n• Amylase: 56\n• Lipase: 129\n• AFP 6.6 (0-10)\n• DEA 3.0 (0-3.4)\n\nImaging Findings:\n4x4cm hepatic mass with necrotic center\nboth early and delayed enhancement\nassociated left portal vein thrombosis and left hepatic lobe atrophy.\n\nUltrasound images of biopsy of heterogeneous liver mass.", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

It is thought that this slow growing tumor (suspected meningioma) was responsible for this patient's loss of consciousness and subsequent motor vehicle accident.", "topic_title": "Suspected meningioma", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Neoplasm, non-glial", "disease_discussion": "Meningiomas originate from arachnoid cap cells and are the most common extraaxial neoplasms of the brain, representing 15-20% of all brain tumors.  Although it is hormonally sensitive and is three times more common in women, meningioma represents a significant proportion of the extraaxial neoplasms in men and in adults of all age groups.  Most patients present between the ages of 40 and 60 years of age.  Meningiomas are uncommon in children without associated neurofibromatosis type-2.  The most common locations for meningiomas (in descending order) are the parasagital dura, convexities, sphenoid wing, juxtasellar, cerebellopontine angle cistern, olfactory groove, posterior fossa clivus, planum sphenoidale, and tentorium.  Uncommon locations are the ventricles (pediatric patients), with a distinct propensity for the left lateral ventricle, and the optic nerve sheath (adult females).  2-3% occur in the spine.  Less than one percent of meningiomas are extradural and result from embryologic arachnoid rests outside the CNS.  These extradural menigiomas have been found in the interdiploic space, outer table of skull, skin, paranasal sinuses, parotid gland, and parapharyngeal space.  Multiple lesions occur in 1-2% of patients increasing to 30% with a previous history of radiation therapy.\n\nMeningiomas often incite a variable amount of intracranial edema with lesions adjacent to the cerebral cortex tending to cause greater edema than those along the basal cisterns or planum.  However, edema is absent in 40% of cases because of slow growth. The lesions themselves demonstrate calcifications in 20% of cases while cystic areas are seen 15% of the time.  Meningiomas can sometimes demonstrate intraosseous extension or grow through the bone or into the dura.  Hyperostosis or osteolysis occur in 20% to 46% of cases.  Hyperostosis is particularly common when the tumor is at the skull base or anterior cranial fossa where it may resemble fibrous dysplasia or Paget’s disease.  The skull base is the one region where meningiomas can become unresectable because of collateral damage to vital structures.  Occasionally, meningiomas may have necrotic centers.  Thrombosis and, rarely, osteblastic, chondromatous, or fatty degeneration occurs.  Meningiomas may encase and narrow adjacent vessels.  Meningiomas often parasitize pial vessels.  As such, these lesions have both a dural and a pial blood supply.  In the typical convexity or sphenoid wing meningioma, the middle meningeal artery is enlarged.\n\nAtypical meningiomas make up 2.4% of all meningiomas and are classified as WHO grade II.  Atypical lesions must exhibit increased mitotic rates, small cells with high nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio, prominent nucleoli, sheet like growth, and foci of necrosis causing nonhomogenous enhancement.  They look like benign meningiomas radiographically, but recur more frequently.  Hemorrhage is common as are peripheral low density zones from trapped CSF in arachnoid cysts.\n\nMelignant meningiomas are classified as WHO grade III, are uncommon and are usually diagnosed when intraparenchymal invasion, markedly rapid growth, or sarcomatous degeneration has taken place, most likely arising from benign tumors gone awry.  The papillary variety of meningioma undergoes malignant differentiation more commonly than the rest.  Higher grade is associated with a higher rate of recurrence.  Survival varies with the site, size, grade, and extent of surgical removal of tumor.\n\nRadiation therapy induces five times more meningiomas than it does schwannomas or sarcomas.  Diagnosis of radiation induced meningioma is made if the meningioma arises in the radiation field, appears after a latency period (of years), was not the primary tumor irradiated, and is not seen in a patient with neurofibromatosis.  Low dose radiation treatment for tinea capitis has been associated with meningiomas following a latency period of about 35 years.  Recurrence rates are higher in radiation-induced meningiomas than in non-radiation induced tumors.\n\nOn unenhanced CT scan, 75% of meningiomas are slightly hyperdense while 25% are isodense to normal brain parenchyma.  Strong, homogenous enhancement is a hallmark (90%).  Signal intensity is similar to normal falx on enhanced and nonenhanced CT.  Calcifications are seen in 20% of lesions and cystic areas are present in 15% of tumors.  The tumors appear round and unilobulated with sharp margins.  A lobulated, extraaxial, parasagittal mass with a dural tail is a typical finding on CT scan.  Rarely, they may appear en plaque, with pancake-like spread along the dura.  Extension of tumor or dural reaction along a dural surface is not uncommon and is known as a “dural tail” which is suggestive, but not specific for meningioma.  Bony erosions are rare, but are more common with malignant meningiomas, where as hyperostosis is more common and more often associated with benign nature.\n\nTumors are typically isointense to gray matter on MRI with strong gadolinium enhancement.  MRI is the best technique for detecting the dural tail.  Increased vascular flow voids within and around the lesion are characteristic.\n\nAngiographic characteristics include a spoke-wheel appearance with dense venous filling, a persistent tumor blush (“comes early and stays late”) with well demarcated margins and a dural vascular supply.

The detection of a cystic lesion with an even thick capsule containing peripheral or lumenal soft tissue nodules or septations is less consistent with a pseudocyst and more indicative of a neoplastic process with associated necrosis. When the attenuation values of the pseudocyst are slightly elevated, associated necrotic tissue or secondary infection should be suspected. Higher attenuation values of >40 to 50 HU are indicative of intracystic hemorrhage.", "topic_title": "Pancreatic Pseudocyst", "acr_code": "7.2", "category": "Inflammatory, NOS", "disease_discussion": "Pancreatic pseudocysts are non-epithelial lined cystic fluid collections that arise from disruption of a pancreatic duct, with leakage of amylase-rich pancreatic juice into the surrounding peripancreatic tissues. Pancreatic pseudocysts are one of four cystic lesions of the pancreas but accounts for 75% of all pancreatic cysts. The other three lesions include 1) benign and malignant cystic neoplasms (10%), 2) congenital cysts (5%), and 3) retention cysts (10%). Although pancreatic pseudocysts are the most common cystic lesion, neoplastic cysts must always be considered, particularly when contemplating nonsurgical treatment of a pancreatic cyst, since no diagnostic test or method is definitive or sensitive enough to distinguish the two.\n\n-Etiology and Pathogenesis: \nPseudocysts form after rupture of a pancreatic duct with extravasation of amylase-rich fluid and failure of reabsorption of this secretion. The extravasated fluid forms an encapsulated collection that is bound by surrounding viscera, that is, the stomach, spleen, liver, and transverse mesocolon. The fluid collections initially communicate with the ruptured pancreatic duct. Endoscopic studies have shown that pancreatic pseudocysts communicate with the pancreatic duct in 80% of cases. Pseudocysts are preceded by pancreatitis in 90% of cases and by trauma in 10%. Approximately 85% are located in the body or tail of the pancreas and 15% in the head. Some patients have two or more pseudocysts. Abdominal pain, with or without radiation to the back, is the usual presenting complaint. A palpable, tender mass may be found in the middle or left upper abdomen. The serum amylase level is elevated in 75% of patients at some point during their illness and may fluctuate markedly\n\n-Epidemiology: \nAxial imaging in acute pancreatitis has demonstrated peripancreatic fluid collections in as many as 80% of studies. Pseudocysts occur less frequently than do acute fluid collections and require more time to form with prevalence ranging from 5% to 70% depending on the severity of the attack and the depth of investigation. There is no gender preference. \n\n-Clinical Manifestations:  \nPseudocysts usually require at least 4 or more weeks to evolve, following an episode of acute pancreatitis. However, the natural history and clinical relevance of pancreatic pseudocysts have been challenging due to lack of unified methods of dectection. Cysts have indeterminate age and most are stable on follow-up examinations. Symptomatic cysts may manifest as persistent abdominal pain with or without radiating to back, abdominal mass, gastric outlet obstruction, and biliary obstruction. Infection is suspected in septic patients and, unless air bubbles produced gas-forming bacteria are present, the diagnosis should be confirmed with FNA. A pseudocyst that does not resolve spontaneously may lead to serious complications, such as (1) pain caused by expansion of the lesion and pressure on other viscera, (2) rupture, (3) hemorrhage, and (4) abscess. Rupture of a pancreatic pseudocyst is a particularly serious complication. Shock almost always supervenes. Mortality rates range from 14%, if the rupture is not associated with hemorrhage, to over 60% if hemorrhage has occurred. Rupture and hemorrhage are the prime causes of death from pancreatic pseudocyst. A triad of findings: (1) increase in the size of the mass, (2) a localized bruit over the mass, and (3) a sudden decrease in hemoglobin level and hematocrit without obvious external blood loss, should alert one to the possibility of hemorrhage from a pseudocyst.\n\n-Treatment:   \nIn studies with sonography, pseudocysts were seen to resolve in 25 to 40% of patients. Pseudocysts that are greater than 5 cm in diameter and that persist for longer than 6 weeks should be considered for drainage. Recent natural history studies have suggested that noninterventional, expectant management is the best course in selected patients with minimal symptoms and no evidence of active alcohol use in whom the pseudocyst appears mature by radiography and does not resemble a cystic neoplasm.

It may contain areas of necrosis, which lead to hemorrhage and the appearance of cystic structures. True cysts may also be seen. Extension of the tumor mass into the corresponding renal vein is seen in about 40% of cases, and is associated with a higher incidence of surgical complications. Extension into the IVC is associated with a 40% rate of surgical complications.

The majority (>90%) of pheochromocytomas are found in the adrenal glands. A 10% rule for pheochromocytomas says that 10% are malignant, 10% are bilateral and 10% are extra-adrenal. They occur with equal frequency in males and females and can occur at any age. The classic symptoms include episodes of headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis and severe hypertension.  24 hour urine tests for catecholamines, metanephrines and VMA are helpful for diagnosis. A new plasma free metanephrines assay has higher sensitivity of 99% compared to 63% for VMA and 83% to 85% for urinary or plasma catecholamines. \n   \n    Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas can occur anywhere that sympathetic nervous tissue exists. Two common locations are the organ of Zuckerkandl and the bladder wall. CT and MRI have high sensitivity for detection of pheochromocytomas. CT is faster, less expensive and generally more available than MRI, but is less specific for distinguishing adrenal pheochromocytoma from other masses.  MRI is more specific for pheochromocytoma, but not as well tolerated as CT.  A nuclear medicine scan with I-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine is more specific and is particularly useful in cases where pheochromocytoma is stronly suspected clinically but not visualized anatomically by CT or MRI as it can screen the entire body for a focus of uptake. The false-negative rate of MIBG scintigraphy is 10%. \nCT typically demonstrates a large adrenal mass without calcification on the non-contrast CT.  If contrast is given the tumor may have heterogenous enhancement.  Contrast is not essential for detection and usually is not given if pheochromocytoma is suspected due to reported cases in which iodinated contrast caused precipitation of hypertensive crisis.   CT is reported to be more than 93% sensitive and 95 % specific for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas.  \n   \n   The differential diagnosis for large necrotic adrenal masses include adrenal cortical carcinomas and metastases, but in the context of confirmatory laboratory values the diagnosis can be made with near 100% accuracy.\n   \n   \n   RadioGraphics 2004;24:S87-S99\n    \n   >>Pheochromocytomas are often clinically silent, and the diagnosis can sometimes be first made at imaging. Although an incidental adrenal nodule is unlikely to represent a pheochromocytoma, additional endocrine investigation is warranted if there is any clinical suspicion for this tumor. As with every imaging interpretation, radiologists should be cognizant of the individual patient’s clinical history and, in particular, of his or her blood pressure status. Despite the fact that most pheochromocytomas have high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, more than 30% have low signal intensity on these images. Although pheochromocytomas usually show increased uptake on FDG PET scans, results at conventional radionuclide imaging can also be inconsistent. However, new PET radioisotopes may allow more consistently accurate tests in the future, and these tests may soon play a larger role in the imaging evaluation of both incidental adrenal masses and suspected pheochromocytomas. Pheochromocytoma currently remains a true imaging chameleon, and its diagnosis should always be considered in the imaging evaluation of a patient with an adrenal mass, hypertension, or characteristic symptoms.\n\n    Most pheochromocytomas have an attenuation higher than 10 HU; rarely do they contain sufficient intracellular fat to have an attenuation of less than 10 HU. Still, some pheochromocytomas could be incorrectly categorized as adenomas. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas with macroscopic fat may also be seen. Conversely, some pheochromocytomas may demonstrate very high attenuation due to hemorrhage. << RadioGraphics 2004;24:S87-S99", "keywords": "pheochromocytomaAdrenal", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1705_synpic23363"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1705_synpic23363", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1705_synpic23363.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "CT with intravenous contrast shows heterogenous enhancement of the left adrenal mass with an area of central hypoenhancement.", "age": "71", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "8.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nHypertension and episodic headaches, palpitations, and diaphoresis.\n\nPhysical Exam:\n24 hour urine lab values\n       METANEPHRINE. . . . .  4764                                  ug/L\n       METANEPHRIN 24H . . .  7146                   (45-290)       ug/24hr\n       NORMETANEPHRINE . . .  3052                                  ug/L\n       NORMETA 24H . . . . .  4578                   (82-500)       ug/24hr\n       METANEPH TOT 24 . .   11724                  (120-700)       ug/24hr\n      EPINEPHRINE 24H . . .   407                  (0.5-20.0)      ug/24 Hr\n       NOREPINEPHRINE. . . .   422                                  ug/L\n       NOREPI 24H. . . . . .   633                   (15-80)        ug/24 Hr\n      CORTSL PT CHA . . . . .  36.2     H          (5.0-18.0)      ug/dL\n\nImaging Findings:\nCT demonstrates a large left adrenal mass without calcification on the non-contrast CT.

This tumor may spread via local extension, hematogenously, or by the lymphatic system. \n\nROBSON CLASSIFICATION FOR STAGING OF RCC:\n     I    - Tumor confined to renal capsule\n     II   - Tumor extends throught renal capsule but is confined    \n            to renal fascia.  Ipsilateral adrenal may be involved\n            in this stage\n     IIIA - Tumor involves renal vein, IVC, or both\n     IIIB - Tumor involves regional lymph nodes\n     IIIC - Tumor involves regional nodes and renal venous structure\n     IVA  - Direct extension of tumor through renal fascia to \n            involve adjacent organs besides ipsilateral adrenal\n     IVB  - Distant metastases\n\nTreatment options include surgery (radical or partial nephrectomy), angioinfarction (arterial tumor embolization), hormonal therapy (e.g. progestins, antiestrogens, and androgens), chemotherapy, immunotherapy (Interferons), and radiation therapy.  Tumor embolization may be used to minimize blood loss during surgery or to produce palliation. Objective tumor regression after treatment with hormonal agents is achieved in less than 6% of patients. Immunotherapy is mainly used in patients with metastatic RCC after resection of primary tumors with successful results in about 20% to 30% of patients with 5% to 10% complete responses. RCC is relatively radioresistant tumor. The role of radiation therapy is primarily in preoperative reduction in the size and fixation of tumors.\n\nCT FINDINGS IN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA\n     - Most occur in the renal cortex and demonstrate an exophytic growth pattern.  They distort the renal contour and larger tumors involve both the renal cortex and medulla.  Solid tumors may be hyperdense, hypodense, or hyperdense on non-enhanced CT. Some lesions may appear heterogenous on non-enhanced scans because of hemorrhage and necrosis.  Tumor calcification occurs in approximately 30% of cases.  They may also rarely demonstrate small amounts of adipose tissue.  A combination of fat and calcification shoud suggest RCC because fat-containing AMLs do not usually calcify. Solid RCCs usually demonstrates heterogenous enhancement(>10 HU).  2% to 5% of RCCs are predominantly cystic. Filling defects (clots, tumor thrombus) in the collecting sytem and renal veins may be seen.", "keywords": "renal cell carcinoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1582_synpic39368", "MPX1582_synpic39369", "MPX1582_synpic39370", "MPX1582_synpic39371", "MPX1582_synpic39372", "MPX1582_synpic39373", "MPX1582_synpic39374", "MPX1582_synpic39375", "MPX1582_synpic39376", "MPX1582_synpic39377"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1582_synpic39368", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1582_synpic39368.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Axial CT images after intravenous contrast material administration demonstrate an aggressive enhancing heterogenous exophytic mass arising from the upper pole of the left kidney and extending into the left renal vein.

Common etiologies include diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, neoplasm, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [1].  The most common etiology in patients over 50 is diverticulosis, while the most common etiology in young patients is IBD [1].  Infection is the most common etiology in immunocompromised hosts [1].\n\n     Acute lower gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a potentially life threatening condition.  Although most cases can be managed medically, 10-15% require intervention to control the hemorrhage [2].  Therapeutic options include surgery, vasopressin infusion, endoscopy, and transcatheter embolization.  Surgery is associated with mortality rates as high as 15-30% in emergent operations, and vasopressin is associated with high rates of rebleeding and systemic side effects [2].  Although colonoscopy has become first line in the investigation and treatment of lower GI hemorrhage, endoscopy is limited in cases of massive hemorrhage because the presence of copious amounts of blood and stool in the bowel may prevent visualization of a bleeding source [2].  Given a positive dynamic bleeding scan, mesenteric angiography becomes important not only because it localizes active bleeding, but also because it provides a pathway for potential treatment [2].  Modern transcatheter embolotherapy has become an option in the the management of lower GI hemorrhage, and microcoils are the preferred embolic agent for many interventionalists [2].\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nTable 1.

(Reeder)  The focus here will be considerations in distinguishing diverticular disease versus carcinoma in the setting of large bowel obstruction.  Diverticular disease has sigmoid involvement in 99% of the cases in industrialized Western countries. (Farrell)  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the GI tract and the second most common malignant tumor in the United States. (Beutow)  Approximately 50% arise in the rectum and rectosigmoid area.  Another 25% occur in the sigmoid colon, and the remaining 25% are evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the colon. (Beutow)  The determination of benign versus malignant stricture in the sigmoid colon is very important because of the differences in the treatment.  In addition,  the implications for staging of cancer and determination of appropriate therapy are issues that make identifying the correct diagnosis vital.  Further, large bowel obstruction secondary to sigmoid strictures is not uncommon.  In fact, the most common cause of large bowel obstruction is primary colon cancer estimated at 53% while diverticular disease is the cause in approximately 12% of the cases. (Greenllee)\n\tThe barium enema and computed tomography (CT) are two modalities used often to evaluate the cause of a sigmoid stricture.  There are general characteristics used to delineate benign versus malignant strictures with both. With the barium enema, a gradual zone of transition, preserved mucosal folds and presence of diverticula are considered benign features.  In contrast , an abrupt transition at the site of obstruction, destruction of mucosa and apple core configuration are considered malignant features. (Blakeborough)  It has been shown that in making  the diagnosis of diverticulitis with CT, the most specific findings are pericolonic stranding and length of the involved segment of more than 10 cm. The presence of pericolonic edema also favors diverticulitis. For colon cancer, the most specific findings are the presence of pericolonic lymph nodes and luminal mass. (Chintapalli)  In cases in which the patient presents with large bowel obstruction, both of these modalities may be helpful in evaluating the cause.  An added advantage of  barium enema is its benefit in aiding in the differentiation of mechanical versus pseudoobstruction.\n\tChapman et al reviewed 140 cases of LBO to determine the accuracy of water-soluble contrast enema in comparison with plain abdominal radiography. Findings at laparotomy and follow-up (for the nonoperative cases) were used as the reference. When reviewing the plain radiographs (being aware of the case history), the diagnosis of mechanical obstruction was made with a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 72%, respectively, whereas contrast enema had a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 98%, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

Additionally, any immunocompromised patient may be affected; organ recipients on immunosuppressive treatment, oncologic and hematologic patients, the elderly, severely malnourished children, and patients requiring prolonged corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe most common radiographic finding in patients with PCP consists of diffuse, bilateral symmetric ground-glass reticulonodular, or finely granular opacities occurring in a perihilar, or lower lung zone distribution.  Less commonly, PCP will occur with upper lobe predominance.  If untreated, these opacities may manifest as diffuse air space consolidation. As the disease progresses, interstitial disease will become more pronounced, and air cysts may be noticed in 5% to 35% of patients.  Occasionally, single or multiple nodules, miliary nodules, cavitation, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, and pleural effusion will be identified.  CT typically demonstrates symmetric bilateral ground-glass opacities, which may be diffuse, or have a mosaic pattern with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung giving a “crazy-paving” pattern. Spontaneous pneumothorax may be identified in 5% to 10% of patients, and is more common when cysts are present.   Pneumomediastinum may also be evident occurring by itself or in concert with pneumothorax.\n\nMost patients have characteristic radiographic findings of PCP, eliminating the need for CT.  However, in patients with symptoms and atypical radiographic findings, CT may show ground-glass opacities, that when correlated with the CD4+ count and other clinical markers may allow the correct diagnosis of PCP to be made.  Other causes of ground-glass opacities in patients with AIDS include CMV pneumonia and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.\n\nClinically, patients with PCP demonstrate nonspecific complaints.  Fever, cough, progressive dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, night sweats, and chest pain are all common symptoms.  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are frequently elevated, and patients demonstrate restrictive patterns on pulmonary function tests, with hypoxemia when exercising.  Clinicians may employ induced sputums, or use bronchoscopy with BAL to clinch the diagnosis.  BAL which has close to 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity in diagnosing PCP, is useful when positive, however when results are negative, transbronchial or open lung biopsy may be pursued when the clinical findings suggest a high probability of PCP.

Pathologically enlarged ovaries from cysts, tumors or paraovarian cysts are at risk for torsion.  The most common ovarian neoplasm involved is the benign cystic teratoma. Ovarian torsion may also occur in a normal ovary with a hypermobile adnexa, which may be seen in prepubertal girls and pregnancy, or an excessively long mesosalpinx. Ovarian torsion usually affects young women and more commonly prepubertal girls.  There is also an increased risk during pregnancy. \n\nThe patient presentation may be nonspecific and therefore the patients may undergo extensive evaluation before establishing a diagnosis. Patients typically present with sudden onset or gradual severe lower abdominal or pelvic pain with or without nausea, vomiting and fever. Approximately half of patients with ovarian torsion will have a palpable mass. Initially the torsed ovary undergoes venous stasis and if prolonged, congestion and edema progress with arterial stasis resulting in hemorrhagic necrosis and gangrene. Torsion involves the right ovary more than the left and this is thought due to a potential protective effect of the sigmoid mesentery. \n\nRadiologic evaluation of patients with ovarian torsion is optimally performed with ultrasound but often these patients undergo other imaging modalities due to their nonspecific presentation. Ultrasound findings include a markedly enlarged hypo or hyperechoic midline mass with multiple peripheral cysts/follicles measuring 8-12 mm in diameter. There is often good sound transmission due to edema from vascular engorgement. Cul-de-sac free pelvic fluid may be seen in approximately one third. Absence of ovarian arterial and venous Doppler waveforms is helpful to establish the diagnosis but not always reliable due to the dual blood supply by the uterine and ovarian arteries. Also helpful but not always visible is the “whirlpool” sign from the twisted ovarian pedicle. A complex mass may be identified if there is a cyst or tumor as a lead point.  \n\nComputed tomography may be performed as the initial imaging modality. Findings of ovarian torsion on CT include a large adenxal or ovarian mass with smooth wall thickening and no enhancing solid component. Peripherally located follicles may or may not be visible. Other associated findings include thickening of the involved fallopian tube or visualizing the torsed vascular pedicle as a whorled structure adjacent to the ovarian mass.

AVFs of the lower extremity can be divided into congenital and acquired causes.  Iatrogenic causes, primarily occurring during cardiac catheterization, are the most common etiology.  These may ensue when a needle tract crosses both femoral the artery and vein, and is then dilated during catheterization, creating a communication between the vessels after catheter removal.  In three large series from experienced cardiac catheterization centers, the incidence of AVF was 0.1-0.2%. Similar values have been noted with the use of arterial closure devices. Other femoral arterial complications include pseudoaneurysm formation, hematoma, groin hemorrhage that may require transfusion, and arterial occlusion.  Risk factors for AVF formation during catheterization include low femoral arterial puncture, large arterial sheath size, older age, and prolonged anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy. The incidence is higher in therapeutic compared to diagnostic catheterization (0.9 versus 0.2% in one report).\n\nAlmost all AVFs are clinically silent early in the postcatheterization period. If untreated, the time of onset of clinical presentation ranges from two days to several months after catheterization.  Clinical complications include lower extremity edema, varicose veins, nerve compression, the development of or worsening of intermittent claudication, and rest pain secondary to distal ischemia. The most significant complication is the development of high-output heart failure which, in an older report, was estimated to occur after 0.01 to 0.02 percent of cardiac catheterizations.\n\nEarly diagnosis is dependent upon careful examination of the groin area, with evaluation for a femoral bruit, large hematoma, decreased or absent lower extremity pulses, or a groin pulsatile mass. Any of these findings is suggestive of a vascular complication and needs to be investigated further.  Prior to the development and widespread use of ultrasound-Doppler technology, AVFs were suspected on clinical findings and diagnosed with an arteriogram. However, Doppler ultrasound is the current diagnostic test of choice in evaluating patients with suspected AVFs. The ultrasound image appears as a blush in the extremity and the connecting artery and vein can often be identified.\n\nBecause of greater awareness and ease of diagnosis, AVFs come to attention and, if necessary, are treated early. On the other hand, small AVFs are often monitored with ultrasound imaging. Indications for intervention are lack of spontaneous closure, increase in fistula size, and/or the development of symptoms.  Surgical repair is the most common approach for fistulas that need closure, but other modalities have been evaluated. These nonsurgical alternatives may be particularly important in patients treated with aggressive antiplatelet therapy. One method is ultrasound-guided compression repair or closure (UGCR). This technique involves placing the ultrasound probe on the skin over the AVF and then compressing the area (usually for ten minute periods) with a sufficient force to abolish flow through the fistula without sacrificing distal perfusion of the leg. Compression results in stasis of blood in the fistula and secondary thrombosis.  UGCR has been used successfully in pseudoaneurysms after cardiac catheterization, but only limited data are available for AVFs with variable success.\n\nPreliminary data suggest that percutaneous approaches also may prove to have a role. One report evaluated 53 patients, 21 with an AV fistula and most of the remainder with a pseudoaneurysm, who failed repeated attempts at UGCR. The patients were primarily treated with either implantation of a covered stent or coil embolization. The procedure was successful in 47 (89 percent). Follow-up documented closure of all lesions, but four late stent occlusions occurred at three to six months.  This study and other early investigations are suggestive that percutaneous interventions such as stent placement or embolization may be effective measures to avoid surgical repair when UGCR fails to result in obliteration of the AVF.", "keywords": "AVFcatherizationiatrogenic", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2508_synpic17381"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2508_synpic17381", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2508_synpic17381.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Vascular", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "CECT of the pelvis demonstrates abnormal concentration of contrast within the right femoral vein during arterial phase of enhancement.", "age": "54", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "9.4", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n54 YO male with hx of CAD with PCTA x2 presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain.

In the fifth week of normal embryonic development the midgut rapidly elongates, forming the primary intestinal loop. The vascular supply to the midgut, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), serves as the axis for the primary intestinal loop. The primary intestinal loop elongates so rapidly that the abdominal cavity cannot contain the developing midgut; and, as a result, the primary intestinal loop herniates into the umbilical cord. During this herniation, the developing loop rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise about its axis. In the tenth week of development, the intestinal loop returns to the abdominal cavity, rotating an additional 180 degrees counterclockwise. \n\nThe cephalic limb of the primary loop forms the distal duodenum, the jejunum, and the proximal ileum. The caudal limb forms the distal ileum, the cecum, ascending colon, and most of the transverse colon. \n\nThe proximal or pre-arterial midgut returns to the abdominal cavity first and begins to occupy the right side of the abdominal cavity. The proximal midgut becomes fixed to the posterior abdominal wall at the ligament of Treitz.\n\nAs the distal or post-arterial midgut returns to the abdomen, the counterclockwise rotation causes the cecum to initially occupy the right upper quadrant. The rotation is completed as the cecum migrates to the right iliac fossa in the right lower quadrant (RLQ). \n\nThe ascending colon gradually becomes fixed to the posterior abdominal wall, losing its free mesentery. Normal counterclockwise rotation of the midgut results in a wide-based mesentery. In malrotation, the proximal midgut returns to the abdominal cavity with normal rotation, but the distal midgut fails to rotate completely. As a result, the cecum will become fixed to the posterior abdominal wall in the upper abdomen. This position results in a mesentery with a narrow base that is prone to volvulus and midgut ischemia. \n\nPeritoneal bands of fibrosis that fix the cecum to the right lateral abdominal wall (Ladd’s bands) run anterior to the duodenum and may cause compression and obstruction of the duodenum.\n\nSymptomatic malrotation typically presents in infancy or childhood. The acute symptomatic presentation is usually related to duodenal obstruction or midgut ischemia.  Although it is less common, intestinal malrotation may first become symptomatic in adolescence or adulthood. The later onset of symptoms ranges from chronic abdominal pain to acute mesenteric ischemia. Occasionally, malrotation is discovered as an incidental radiographic finding. \n\nThe management of asymptomatic malrotation is controversial. Some authors have suggested that all asymptomatic patients with malrotation should undergo an open or laparoscopic Ladd’s procedure (transaction of Ladd’s bands, counterclockwise reduction of malrotation, and appendectomy). Others have proposed that prophylactic surgical intervention is only indicated in children with asymptomatic malrotation. \n\nThe prevalence of asymptomatic malrotation is unknown.

Treatment plan currently pending further bone marrow biopsy confirmation of current diagnosis.", "discussion": "This is a case of a 46 year-old black female with a history of sarcoidosis diagnosed at age 32 years, and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosed within the past year now presenting with mulitple myeloma.  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal B-cell malignancy consisting of terminally differentiated plasma cells.  In the United States, the incidence of disease is 3-4 newly diagnosed cases per 100,000 population per year, and represents 1% of all malignancies.  Demographically, patients are commonly African-American, with males slightly outnumbering females by 1.4-1.  Patients are typically elderly with a median age of 65 years at diagnosis, although cases in much younger patients have been reported.\n\nThe patient's presentation for MM is unusual given her relatively young age (46 years), lack of physical findings and history (i.e. fatigue, bone, recurrent infections), and laboratory abnormalities (i.e. hypercalcemia, elevated creatinine, elevated total protein) suggestive of  MM.  The bilateral lacrimal gland amyloidosis is a  unusual initial presentation for MM.  By comparison, lacrimal gland involvement in sarcoidosis is more common affecting 55-61% of patients at sometime during their disease course with similar findings on CT imaging.  Therefore, her management was based on the conclusion her presentation was a manifestation of her sarcoidosis and not MM.  The lack of response to therapy for the lacrimal gland enlargement ultimately prompted a biopsy of the gland six months from the time she sought medical attention, and one year since she reported initially having symptoms. \n\nThe lacrimal gland biopsy showed an inflamatory cell infiltrate, with nodules of pauci-cellular, eosinophillic staining material exhibiting apple-green birefringence on Congo Red staining.  This is consistent with amyloidosis of the lacrimal gland.  The lack of evidence of granulomatous disease present in the biopsy specimen strongly suggests that sarcoidosis is not the etiology of her lacrimal gland enlargement.  \n\nBased on the above findings, the patient received further laboratory and radiological investigations for the diagnosis of MM.   The diagnosis of MM is based on the demonstration of three components: 1) Serum or urine monoclonal protein identified by a characteristic monoclonal M protein spike on electrophoresis of urine and blood specimens; 2) >10% abnormal plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy; and 3) end-organ damage in the form of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, sequelae of amyloid deposition, and/or bone abnormalities on imaging.  Most patients will demonstrate symptomatic sequelae of of end-organ damage.  However, nearly 25% of patients with MM are discovered through incidental findings on laboratory studies and imaging. Indeed, radiographs provided the only significant finding suggestive of MM via a head CT that was obtained for the evaluation of URI symptoms of sinusitis in an emergency department several months prior to the lacrimal gland biopsy.  \n\nThe characteristic radiological feature of MM is the presence of a single osteolytic lucency (plasmacytoma), or, as in this patient's case, multiple discrete osteolytic lucencies (myelomatous) that are subcortical and found predominantly in the axial and proximal appendicular skeleton.  Lesions may also coalesce or take the form of diffuse osteopenia.  Sclerosing myeloma has also been described, although it is rare.  The osteolysis of MM is mediated by the secretion of chemokine factors by the malignant plasma cells that stimulate osteoclast proliferation, chemotaxis, maturation, and activity.  \n\nPlain film radiograph skeletal survey is the preferred diagnostic modality for the detection of bony involvement in MM.  Nearly 50% of the density of bone must be affected before the \"punched-out\" lesions are apparent, however, the presence of bone lesions is confirmed in 60-80% of all patients initially surveyed for MM with radiograph.  Other useful imaging studies include MRI, which may be used for the precise determination of lesion size and location for bone marrow biopsy, targeted radiotherapy, and for characterization of the extent of disease.  Imaging via CT is adjunctive to MRI for guided biopsy of lesions.  Recently, PET scanning has shown promise for monitoring disease recurrence by detection of lesions not readily seen on conventional radiograph.  \n\nDue to the osteolytic nature of MM, nuclear imaging via technec tium-99m (Tc-99m) bone scanning has no role in diagnosis or monitoring.  The sensitivity of Tc-99m scanning is dependent on osteoblastic activity, and therefore, underestimates the extent of disease.  Uptake of Tc-99m into radiographically abnormal regions is only 44% compared to conventional plain film.  This uptake is secondary to osteoblastic activity from pathological fracture, calcification within a plasmacytoma, or amyloidosis in association with tumor.  \n\nThe presence of osteolytic lesions is not pathognomonic of MM, as such findings may be present in a variety of conditions including other osteolytic metastases  and occasionally lymphoma) and hyperparathyroidism  Furthermore, bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement with homogenous soft tissue attenuation seen on CT is more suggestive of lacrimal gland sarcoidosis than other etiologies.  Neoplastic and infectious processes tend to present with discrete lesions within the lacrimal gland and/or are likely unilateral.  The chronicity of symptoms also would argue against a bilateral infection, as such a condition would be likely self-limiting.  The apparent overlap of expected findings in sarcoidosis versus that of MM likely contributed to the lag between initial presentation and diagnosis.", "topic_title": "46 yo female with chronic bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement of >6 mo duration.", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Clinical Vignette or Pearl", "disease_discussion": "HPI: 46 yo african american woman with a history of sarcoidosis presented with one year of intermittent conjunctiva inflammation and bleeding.

Typically heparing and warfarin are the agents employed.  Unfractionated heparin acts primarily as an indirect thrombin inhibitor, and to a lesser extent as a factor Xa inhibitor.  It has the advantage of fast activity, but presents difficulty with dosing (requiring intravenous administration) and monitoring of the patient's PTT.  Dosing normally follows a nomogram and varies from institution to institution depending upon laboratory ranges.  The introduction of low molecular weight heparin, a factor Xa inhibitor, as an alternative to unfractionated heparin allows easier administration with standard dosing, subcutaneous administration, and no laboratory monitoring.  Alternatively, warfarin, an inhibitor of vitamin K-dependant coagulation factors, is typically used for long term out patient anticoagulation needs owing to its oral administration.  Warfarin is monitored therapeutically on a weekly basis with the patient's PT and INR (standard INR goal 2.0-3.0).\n\nAs is the case with nearly all medical interventions, anticoagulation does not come without potential side-effects.  The most significant of these centers around hemorrhage.  Patients undergoing anticoagulation are at increased risk for bleeding, both following trauma and sponaneously.

Common symptoms include dyspnea, jugular venous distention, and edema of the face and upper extremities. The most common cause is malignancy. In cases of SVC syndrome secondary to malignancy, 90% are caused by either bronchogenic carcinoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Around 2-4% of all lung cancer patients will develop SVC syndrome at some point during their disease course. While Hodgkin's lymphoma is known for mediastinal lymphadenopathy, it rarely causes SVC syndrome.\n\nThere are multiple other non-malignant etiologies. Patients with indwelling intravascular catheters can develop thrombosis resulting in obstruction of the vessel. Fibrosing mediastinitis can result in an excessive fibrotic reaction in the mediastinum that can affect multiple structures within this compartment, to include the SVC. Excessive radiation can cause a similar response, with fibrosis of the vessels resulting in SVC syndrome. \n\nThe severity of symptoms can vary based on the rate of occlusion. A rapid SVC occlusion may not allow enough time for systemic compensation with collateral vein formation, thus increasing the severity of symptoms. \n\nPrognosis and treatment varies greatly but is often based on the etiology of disease.  Benign causes of SVC syndrome that can resolve completely if the underlying benign disease is treated. In other cases, such as advanced malignancy, the goal of therapy is palliation, such as use of radiation therapy or vascular stent placement. In general, surgical care is not the best option. \n\nAs most cases of SVC syndrome are due to malignancy, a key question is how advanced the disease as progressed.  If tumor is infiltrating the SVC (and mediastinum), resection will not provide a cure.  In cases of advanced malignancy, the goal of therapy is palliation, such as use of radiation therapyto shrink tumor burden or vascular stent placement for symptom relief.

Autosomal recessive is associated with worse outcomes, as most patient’s die from infection or bone marrow failure before adolescence.  The autosomal dominant form is frequently discovered incidentally in adulthood with benign outcomes. \n\nClinical presentations for the autosomal recessive form include failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia, and cranial nerve dysfunction.

There is perinidal bone marrow edema and soft tissue inflammation if evaluated on MRI; but, in the right clinical setting, this modality is often unnecessary.  A nuclear medicine study will help differentiate this lesion from osteomyelitis – both an osteoid osteoma and osteomyelitis can look identical on plain films and CT.  A bone scan of an osteoid osteoma will demonstrate a “double density” sign due to the excessive vascular supply of the nidus.

Cerebral hemorrhage is the next most common with almost 1 in 5 patients.  Venous occlusive disease is the next, but much less frequent than the previous mentioned etiologies.\n\nThe two most common causes of thromboembolic disease are atherosclerosis and cardiac origin.  Atherosclerosis follows a typical distribution of accumulation within the arterial distribution of the brain.  The internal carotid artery is first, then the distal basilar artery, carotid siphon, and middle cerebral artery.  The parts of the brain perfused by the middle cerebral artery and basilar artery are most vulnerable to infarct due both the region of atherosclerotic disease and flow patterns that cause more proximal sources of thrombus to favor those vessels.\n\nThe first patient’s infarct is due to occlusion of penetrating vessels of the right middle cerebral artery.  Likely the lenticulostriates which supply the lentiform nucleus, caudate capsule, and internal capsule, as well as the thalamoperferators were affected.  These types of strokes, when smaller than 15mm, are called lacunar infarcts and they account for 20% of all strokes.  Patients with lacunar infarcts can present with a pure motor hemiparesis like this patient or a pure hemisensory deficit, hemiparetic ataxia, dysarthria, or hand deficit.\n\nCT examination early in the course of an acute stroke can be negative and cannot exclude this diagnosis.

In this case, imaging findings were confirmed with fecal cultures.", "topic_title": "Pseudomembranous Colitis", "acr_code": "7.2", "category": "Infection, bacteria", "disease_discussion": "Many of the findings of colonic inflammation are fairly characteristic of the specific type of colitis that is present.  CT findings used to differentiate one form of colitis from another include:\n\nDegree of mural thickening\nExtent to which the layers of the thickened colonic wall are visible\nPresence of fistulae or abscesses\nAnatomic distribution of the CT abnormalities in the large and small intestine\n\n \nUlcerative colitis involves the rectum in virtually all patients. It extends proximally in one continuous segment to involve the remainder of the colon to a variable extent. Computed tomography shows mild-to-moderate, concentric, mural thickening.  The mucosa, the low-density, thickened submucosa, and the serosa are usually visible as three distinct layers. These abnormalities sometimes give the rectum a target-like appearance.  In most patients, there is loss of the normal haustral contour and the colon is shortened. Fistulae and pericolonic abscesses are rare. Proliferation of the perirectal fat is also commonly seen.\n\nIn patients with Crohn disease (granulomatous colitis), the entire colon and distal small bowel may be involved; the most common sites are the terminal ileum, right colon, and rectum. Normal intervening segments, so-called skip areas, often separate affected segments of bowel. The colonic wall tends to be thicker than in patients with ulcerative colitis.  The layers of the affected bowel wall may be similar in CT attenuation, giving the wall a homogeneous appearance, but this is not always the case.  Typically, there is inflammation of the pericolonic fat, which appears as a diffuse, hazy increase in its CT attenuation, reflecting the transmural nature of this disease.  As in patients with ulcerative colitis, carcinoma can occasionally develop. In this setting, adenocarcinoma is sometimes scirrhous in type and its CT appearance can mimic that of a benign inflammatory stricture.  Fistulae are common in patients with granulomatous colitis, particularly in the perirectal area.  Abdominal abscesses also may develop adjacent to severely affected segments of bowel.\n\nPseudomembranous colitis is caused by toxins produced by Clostridium difficile, a gram-positive bacterium that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract in some patients receiving antibiotic therapy.  CT shows characteristic marked thickening of the colonic wall and interhaustral folds, which are sometimes so severe as to nearly obliterate the colonic lumen.  The entire colon is usually involved, but involvement confined to the right colon is not unusual.  Strand-like pattern of edema in the pericolonic fat is present in nearly half of cases.  Fifteen percent of patients have ascites.\n\nCytomegalovirus colitis is seen in the setting of an immunocompromised patient.  Findings mimic those of C. difficile disease, with profound thickening of the colonic wall and haustra and pericolonic edema.  In both conditions, the mural thickening is largely the result of an edematous submucosal layer that has a low CT attenuation value. \n\nDisseminated histoplasmosis is being seen with increasing frequency because of the susceptibility of patients with AIDS to this disease, especially in endemic areas.  Colonic lesions often have an “apple-core” appearance on barium enema, which appear on CT as one or more focal areas of mural thickening with adjacent adenopathy of mixed attenuation.  Usually, tissue diagnosis is required to separate these lesions from adenocarcinoma.\n\nColitis due to Schistosoma japonicum presents as left colon mild mural thickening with obliteration of the normal haustral pattern.  Frequently, there is a peculiar pattern of curvilinear calcification in the colonic wall.  Since dense radioopaque contrast can obscure these calcifications, water should be considered as a colonic contrast agent when schistosomiasis is considered a possible etiology. \n\nBeh?et disease most commonly involves the ileocecal region and ascending, but abnormalities may occur anywhere in the colon.  Marked focal thickening of the colonic wall surrounds isolated large cecal ulcers.  This appearance may easily be confused with the ileocecal mural thickening of tuberculosis, which may be distinguished based on associated with low-density caseating lymph nodes in the mesentery.  In the setting of neutropenia, typhlitis may present with low-attenuation cecal mural thickening, with or without mural gas.\n\nFinally, a noninflammatory etiology that must be considered is ischemia.  This classically involves the descending colon and may involve the spenic flexure and sigmoid region.

In utero, the ductus arteriosus (DA) serves as a shunt between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, allowing fetal blood to bypass the high-pressure vascular system of the lungs, which are filled with fluid and not serving to oxygenate blood. \nShortly after birth, the lungs fill with air and the pressure within the pulmonary vasculature drops, reversing the shunt through the DA. The DA begins to close at this time, and eventually fibroses and becomes the ligamentum arteriosum, and there is no more shunt. \nIn some people, the DA does not close, so that a left-to-right shunt persists from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. The diameter and length of the PDA, and thus the amount of arterial blood being shunted to the lungs, determines whether or not the PDA causes symptoms or eventual complications.  In general, there are three categories (small, moderate, large) based on the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of blood through the PDA.\nA small PDA may never be detected, because the amount of higher-pressure arterial blood being shunted to the pulmonary artery is not enough to cause pulmonary hypertension or exercise intolerance, as may be seen in larger shunts. The astute clinician may detect a continuous flow murmur during cardiac auscultation, but this is not always present. \nA moderate size PDA may cause exercise intolerance when lower extremity demand for oxygen is not met by left ventricular output, because some of the blood is being shunted back into the pulmonary circulation before it circulates systemically. The upper extremities may not be affected to the same degree, because the DA arises distal to the Left Subclavian Artery, and thus the upper extremities receive blood before it is shunted back into the pulmonary system. Also, as a result of this shunting, the left heart receives a larger volume of blood and, over time, this can result in left ventricular dilation and eventual dysfunction. These patients will likely have an audible flow murmur. \nA large PDA causes a significant shunt and overloading of the left ventricle because it must pump a larger amount of blood. This can result in dilation and LV failure. In addition, the higher systemic blood pressure is transmitted through the PDA to the normally-low pressure pulmonary vascular bed. Over time, this will result in pulmonary hypertension, which may become severe enough to overcome the systemic pressure and result in a reversal of the shunt (Eisenmenger Syndrome).  Now deoxygenated blood passes from the pulmonary artery through the PDA into the systemic circulation and mixes with arterial blood.

The small bowel contains more than 75 percent of the length and about 90 percent of the mucosal surface area of the gastrointestinal tract but is the least common site of primary cancer within the GI tract. It is much more uncommon than colorectal cancer, gastric or esophageal cancer.  Conditions with higher incidence of small bowel adenocarcinoma include familial polyposis, AIDS, Peutz-Jeghers, Lynch II syndrome, celiac disease and Crohns disease.  \nMalignant small bowel tumors tend to be symptomatic; whereas, benign tumors are often found incidentally. Symptoms initially are vague including abdominal pain, weight loss, occult fecal blood (50%) and jaundice (33% of duodenal tumors). 1/2 to 2/3 of cases are discovered late in their course at emergency laparotomy for obstructive symptoms.

The introduction of MR compatible hardware for spine stabilization and modification of life support devices for use in MR scanning has made imaging of the acutely injured spine possible.  Cord edema and hemorrhage are frequently seen in the acutely traumatized spinal cord.  Cord edema can cause focal enlargement of the cord, but more frequently elongates T1/T2 due to the water content.  This is usually best seen on T2-weighted images as an area of increased signal.  Clinically, it may be important to distinguish an edematous cord from a hemorrhagic contusion (3).  Cord hemorrhages evolve similarly to intracerebral hemorrhage, and therefore acute hemorrhages tend to have low T1 and T2 signal characteristics.  On the T2-weighted sequences, the hemorrhagic low signal portion is often surrounded by a ring of high signal intensity edema.  Finally, cord maceration and transection represent the most severe form of cord injury.  This is usually seen as a loss of cord signal or marked inhomogenity of signal where the cord should be.

It is likely multifactoral including  genetic influence, dysfunctional immune response, enteric normal flora bacteria, and other environmental factors.  It is believed to be the result of an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Most cases involve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Crohn disease typically affects the bowel asymmetrically, involving the mesenteric side more severely than the antimesenteric border. Although any area of the GI system may be affected, the most common site of disease is the ileo-cecal region, followed by the colon.  Microscopically, the initial lesion appears as a focal inflammatory infiltrate around the crypts, followed by ulceration of superficial mucosa, then by deeper invasion and non-caseating granulomas. Grossly, the early abnormality is hyperemia and edema of the involved mucosa. Later, superficial ulcers form, which become deep serpentine linear ulcers located both longitudinally and transversely giving the mucosa a “cobblestone” appearance. The lesions are often segmental; being separated by healthy areas, hence the term “skip lesions”. Transmural inflammation results in thickening of the bowel wall and narrowing of the lumen. As the disease progresses, it is complicated by obstruction, fistula formation, abscess formation, adhesions, and malabsorption.\n\nClinical: The characteristic presentation of Crohn disease is with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which may be complicated by intestinal fistula formation, obstruction, or both. Unpredictable flares and remissions with a long course characterize Crohn’s. Treatment is generally medical including antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, and sometimes antibiotics. Chronic complications include fistulas, adhesions, and marked luminal narrowing with partial bowel obstruction which may require surgery.\n\nRadiographic findings:\nRadiological evaluation includes diagnosis, evaluation of distribution, and evaluation for complications. The distribution of small bowel Crohn’s disease is best assessed by enteroclysis and CT. The terminal ileum is nearly always involved in small bowel disease and is the only site in up 30 % of patients.\n  \nSmall bowel contrast studies: The sensitivity of enteroclysis is reported as very good in detecting Crohn’s disease but often does not correlate well with disease activity. Superficial abnormalities include thickened folds due to mucosal edema, transverse and longitudinal ulcers, punctate collections of barium, and small nodules. Transmural abnormalities include deep fissures and penetrating ulcers.  Cobblestoning results from intersecting longitudinal and transverse ulcers with intervening heaped-up edematous tissue.  Deep ulcerations may result in fistulae. Thickened bowel may appear as separations of loops. Luminal narrowing is always present resulting from spasm and edema during the acute phase or fibrotic strictures in chronic disease. Ileitis can also manifest as a “sting sign” on barium study secondary to spasm or fibrotic stricture fromation.  The mesenteric aspect and adjacent mesentery are commonly affected more than the antimesenteric border. Extramural mesenteric inflammation and abscesses may induce compression and displacement of bowel loops.\n\nCross sectional imaging: Both CT and MR imaging are reported to have a sensitivity of over 95% for the detection of Crohn disease.  At more advanced stages, CT and MR imaging can help identify and characterize pathologically altered bowel segments as well as extraluminal lesions including abscesses, fat stranding, and adenopathy.

Structurally MIBG resembles norepinephrine and guanethidine (neurosecretory-depleting agent).  MIBG is taken up into the storage granules of both normal and abnormal neural crest cells.  The uptake is proportional to the number of neurosecretory granules within a tumor.  MIBG uptake is blocked by many drugs.  Catecholamine agonists (phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), antipsychotics (phenothiazines), tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, long acting beta blockers (labetalol), drugs that deplete catocholamine stores (reserpine, guanethidine) and cocaine are examples of drugs that interfere with MIBG uptake.  Radiolabeling is done with I-123 and I-131  (I-123:  half life 13.2 hrs, energy 159 KeV; I-131: half life 8.1 days, energy 364 KeV).  \nI-123 MIBG is used in much larger administration activities because of its much lower absorbed radiation dose per mCi compared with I-131.  In addition, current  gamma camera detection crystals can more efficiently detect the 159 KeV photons.  Collimation is easier at lower energy and I-123 has a higher photon flux at 24 hour imaging.  For these reasons MIBG studies with \n\nI-123 is of considerably higher quality than with I-131.  Normal distribution of  MIBG includes salivary glands, myocardium, liver and urine.  Amount in the GI tract is variable and related to excretion into the gut.  A small percentage of patients show some activity in a blocked thyroid gland, normal adrenals, lung, and skeletal muscle.  In normal subjects, activity should not be seen in bone, bone marrow or spleen.  Utilizing SPECT MIBG can increase certainty of interpretation over planar imaging although it has not shown to increase the number of lesions detected.\nAlthough in this particuar case, the tumor was not identified on planar images but it was visualized on SPECT imaging.   Overall, primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, bone and bone marrow metastasis are detected using MIBG.\n\nPheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of chromaffin cells most commonly arising from the adrenal medulla. An estimated 800 cases are diagnosed yearly in the U.S. The peak incidence is in the third to fifth decades of life. Bilateral disease is present in approximately 10% of patients. Bilaterality is much more common in familial pheochromocytoma, often found in association with the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN, types IIA and IIB). In patients with MEN type II syndromes, the risk of developing a contralateral tumor following unilateral adrenalectomy is approximately 50%. Other syndromes associated with pheochromocytoma include neurofibromatosis, von Hippel-Lindau disease, cerebellar hemangioblastoma, Sturge-Weber\\'s syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis. Therefore, all patients with pheochromocytomas should be screened for MEN-2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease to avert further morbidity and mortality in the patients and their families. Extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma or functional paraganglioma occurs in approximately 10% to 15% of cases and may arise from any extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue in the body associated with sympathetic ganglia. \n\nExtra-adrenal pheochromocytoma is most often located within the abdomen and may have greater malignant potential than adrenal pheochromocytoma.  Extra-adrenal tumors usually have a poorer prognosis than adrenal tumors.  Due to the production and release of catecholamines, pheochromocytomas cause hypertension. However, only 0.1% to 0.5% of all hypertension patients will be found to have a pheochromocytoma. The importance of the recognition of this disease is that over 90% of patients properly diagnosed and treated are curable.\n\nThe hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma may be sustained or paroxysmal and is often severe with occasional malignant features of encephalopathy, retinopathy and proteinuria. Less commonly, severe hypertensive reactions may occur during incidental surgery, following trauma, exercise, or micturition (in the setting of bladder pheochromocytoma) when the diagnosis is unsuspected. Other clinical features of pheochromocytoma include headache, sweating, palpitation, tachycardia and severe anxiety along with epigastric or chest pain. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is established by the demonstration of elevated 24-hour urinary excretion of free catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) or catecholamine metabolites (VMA and total metanephrines). The measurement of plasma catecholamines can also be of value in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. However, the measurement of plasma catecholamines has limited sensitivity and specificity. Plasma metanephrines have been reported to be more sensitive than plasma catecholamines. \n\nOnce the diagnosis is confirmed by biochemical determinations the localization and extent of disease should be determined. Ninety-seven percent are found in the abdomen, 2% to 3% in the thorax, and 1% in the neck. The initial studies should be a chest film and abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan. \n\nI123meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) has been found to be useful as a scintigraphic localization agent. If the tumor is not adequately localized by these methods then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or rarely, vena cava catheterization with selective venous sampling for catecholamines may be indicated. CT and MRI scans are about equally sensitive (98%-100%), while MIBG scanning has a sensitivity of only 80%. However, MIBG scanning has a specificity of 100%, compared to specificity of 70% for CT and MRI.  Surgical resection is the standard curative modality.

The aberrant right subclavian artery forms secondary to the involution of a segment of the embryonic right 4th aortic arch, between the right subclavian and right common carotid arteries.  Thus, the right subclavian artery arises from the posterior medial wall of the aorta arch as the last branching vessel, crosses the retrotracheal space posterior to the esophagus, and lays anterolateral to the spine ascending on the right towards the thoracic inlet.  \n\nThis anomaly may go undetected on chest radiographs, and is incidentally detected on CT scans obtained for other reasons.  On the lateral chest radiograph, findings may be normal, or the anomalous artery will be visualized as an area of increased density in the retrotracheal space, with a focal impression upon the posterior wall of the trachea.

Quoted figures are in the order of 1 to 10 cases per 100,00 population per year, but this is almost certainly an underestimate as many cases remain subclinical.  Sarcoidosis occurs with about 10 times greater frequency in blacks than in whites.  \n\nPresentation is most common between 20 and 40 years of age.  The mode of presentation varies among series, depending on racial mix and the use of screening radiography.  In white-dominated series, presentation as an incidental radiographic finding is common and may occur in 40-50% of cases.  Respiratory illness, erythema nodosum, ocular symptoms, and other skin lesions represent the other common presentations.  In predominantly black series, respiratory and systemic symptoms like fatigue, malaise, weakness, weight loss, and fever are most common.\n\nA firm diagnosis for sarcoidosis can be made with consistent clinicoradiologic findings and histologic evidence of widespread non-caseating granulomas in more than one organ or a positive Kveim skin test.  In clinical practice the organs most commonly sampled are lymph nodes, liver, and lung. \n\nLaboratory investigations also show elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels.  Serum ACE levels correlate with degree of total body granuloma burden and the activity of clinical disease as a whole but not convincingly with the degree of and activity of pulmonary disease.  \n\nSarcoidosis can be managed conservatively.  If treatment is indicated then steroids are the agents of choice.  Indications for treating chest disease are not firmly established but most patients with symptomatic or progressive stage II or III disease will be on treatment.  There is no doubt in the short-term efficacy of steroids but the long-term value is less clear.  The majority of deaths from sarcoidosis are related to pulmonary or cardiac disease. \n\nSarcoidosis is commonly staged according to its appearance on the chest radiograph:\n\nStage 0 – clear\nStage I – node enlargement only\nStage II – node enlargement and parenchymal shadowing\nStage III – parenchymal shadowing only\nStage IV – Fibrosis with distortion and bullae\n\nThe stage at presentation is generally considered to correlate with prognosis.\n\nLymphadenopathy is the most common intrathoracic manifestation of sarcoidosis.  Symmetric, bilateral hilar adenopathy with some form of paratracheal adenopathy is the classic pattern.  Fluctuation in nodal enlargement during intermittent steroid treatment is well recognized.  Sarcoid nodes may calcify.\n\nParenchymal shadowing is seen at the time of presentation in a little under a half of the patients with sarcoidosis.  A practical division is that between reversible and irreversible opacities.  \n\nReversible changes consist of three patterns:  reticulonodular opacities, ill-defined opacities with characteristics of consolidation (alveolar), and large nodules.  These patterns can occur alone or in varying combinations.  They may resolve partially or completely, or they may progress to a irreversible, fibrotic pattern.  Such fibrosis ranges from minor and radiologically undetectable, to gross with scar-like shadowing and distortion on the chest radiograph.\n\nOn HRCT, sarcoidosis is characterized by mid-upper zone peribronchovascular thickening and irregularity with small nodules distributed in a perilymphatic fashion: along bronchovascular margins, along interlobular septa, and subpleurally (including fissures).  The most common and almost universal finding is small, 1 to 5 mm nodules, usually with irregular but sharp borders.  \n\nFocal opacities larger than 1cm in diameter maybe cause by localized areas of consolidation – alveolar sarcoid – characterized by ill-defined margins and an air bronchogram.  \n\nGround glass opacity is seen in about 40% of patients.  It is patchy and may have a lobular distribution.  Ground glass opacity is usually produced by multiple granulomas rather than alveolitis.\n\nScarring causes a number of signs: lobular distortion, traction bronchiolectasis, honeycombing, and cyst or bullae formation.  Nodules, consolidation, ground-glass opacity, and septal lines are potentially reversible.  On the contrary irregular course lines, cysts, honeycombing, bronchiolectasis, and distortion are permanent.", "keywords": "Sarcoidosis", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1713_synpic30211", "MPX1713_synpic30213"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1713_synpic30211", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1713_synpic30211.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Noncontrast CT examination of of the chest demonstrates bilateral hilar adenopathy as well as mediastinal adenopathy.

It is typically agreed upon that treatment should begin if the patient is symptomatic, if lung function is deteriorating, or the radiological findings associated with sarcoidosis are worsening.  The current primary treatment is with daily oral corticosteroids.  The best dose is not known so a dose must be chosen by balancing the risk of adverse effects versus the benefits of therapy.

Although they are histologically identical and have similar clinical behavior, there are differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, and genetic features between the three forms:\n\n»»The nonendemic (sporadic) form usually has an abdominal presentation, most often with massive disease and ascites, involving the distal ileum, stomach, cecum and/or mesentery, kidney, testis, ovary, breast, bone marrow, or central nervous system.

It is thought that the abnormal fusion likely occurs when the kidneys are still in the pelvis and the renal capsule is not fully developed.

The kidneys ascend to their normal positions between the fourth and ninth weeks of gestation.  Complications include: ureteropelvic junction obstruction, recurrent UTI (urine stasis and vesicoureteric reflux), recurrent stone formation, and increased risk of trauma (due to kidney positioning). Horseshoe kidney may occur as an isolated anomaly or associated with other anomalies.

Craniosynostosis is not noted in the literature as being associated with XXY genotypes.", "topic_title": "Unilateral Coronal Synostosis", "acr_code": "1.1", "category": "Congenital, malformation", "disease_discussion": "Synostosis is the premature closure of one or more of the calvarial sutures which limits the ability of the skull to expand in a direction perpendicular to the suture. The sutures are dynamic: as the brain grows, the sutures expand, adding new bone.  An infant’s brain grows rapidly, doubling in 6 months and again in 2 years.  If the sutures are compressed, either mechanically or due to failure of underlying CNS expansion, the sutures may either resorb or fuse.  Underlying brain growth causes increased growth parallel to the suture, resulting in characteristic head shapes.  Synostoses can be primary (fusion of single suture as an isolated event) or secondary, often associated with several syndromes. The prevalence of primary synostosis is about 1/4000 to 1/1000 live births. An inherited tendency or family history has been reported in many cases in the literature, however, most cases of isolated craniosynostosis are usually sporadic in occurrence with no known etiology.\n\nTrue craniosynostosis will not improve with time and usually worsens with growth.\n\nDiagnosis is made on the basis of characteristic head shape, presence of ridges overlying fused sutures, and rotation of facial landmarks. Radiologic studies are discussed below.\n\nClinically, signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may also be present (vomiting, lethargy). Some synostoses are diagnosed in the context of syndromes (discussed below). \nA quick basic anatomy review is helpful before naming the synostoses. The bones of the calvarium are divided by sutures The metopic suture divides the frontal bones. The frontal bones are separated from the parietal bones by the coronal suture, and the two parietal bones are separated from each other by the sagittal suture. The occipital bone is separated from the parietal bones by the lambdoidal sutures. The space where the metopic, coronal and sagittal sutures come together is the anterior fontanel, and the posterior fontanel is present where the lambdoidal and sagittal sutures meet.\n\nCranial synostoses definitions are as follows:\nSagittal craniosynostosis results in scaphocephaly (keel/boat skull).\nMetopic craniosynostosis results in trigonocephaly (triangular skull).\nLambdoidal synostosis results in plagiocephaly (asymmetric skull).\nCoronal synostosis results in brachycephaly (short skull) if bilateral and frontal plagiocephaly if unilateral with ipsilateral eyebrow elevation giving the classic “harlequin eye” appearance.\nBetween 10-20% of synostoses are associated with syndromes. Most of these syndromes are sporadic in occurrence. However, if one parent and one sib are affected, subsequent siblings have about 50% risk of having the syndrome. The most common is Crouzon syndrome involving the sagittal and coronal sutures with shallow orbits, proptosis, hypertelorism and sometimes hydrocephalus. \n\nApert Syndrome involve the coronal, sagittal and lambdoidal sutures with facial dysmorpism, syndactyly and cardiac defects.  Other rarer syndromes include Carpenter’s, Pfeiffer’s and Conrad’s syndromes.\n\nRadiologic workup should center around CT. CT remains the most sensitive barometer of bony fusion. Plain films of the skull may appear normal.  Bone windows and thin slices are necessary with conventional axial CT slices. 3-D CT has simplified the diagnosis and has been show in studies to increase sensitivity. Three-dimensional CT scan processing by shaded-surface reconstruction, volumetric, and depth-coded methods have been shown to be superior to conventional plain radiographs and CT scans in diagnosing craniosynostosis.  The skull base and brain may show underlying abnormalities in the syndromic craniosynostoses. If the patient has increased intercranial pressure, calvarial table resorbtion has been seen with unknown clinical significance.\n\nMost patients with simple craniosynostosis have no neurological compromise, therefore corrective surgery is cosmetic. If the child is 18 months and the deformity is mild, it will not likely worsen and surgery can be avoided.  Conservative therapy involves positional therapy (head position while sleeping and controversial helmet therapy).\n\nSurgical correction is often done for psychosocial reasons with good results. Timing of surgical reconstruction is also controversial with some advocating early intervention (3-4 mos) and others recommend waiting until 8-10mos for better long-term results with less morbidity.  Most craniosynostoses today can be treated with a single surgery with excellent cosmetic results and minimal morbidity and nearly nonexistent mortality.", "keywords": "Cranial Synostosiscranial Stenosisplagiocephaly", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1357_synpic17883"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1357_synpic17883", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1357_synpic17883.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial CT bone window showing right displacement of the lambdoid suture and absent right coronal suture.", "age": "5", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.1", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n5 y/o former 24 wk prematue infant with 5 mo NICU with multiple medical problems including history of IVH, CP, MR, congenital cardiac defects including PDA and ASD, and 47 XXY.

IPMN is classified into three types: branch pancreatic duct type, main pancreatic duct type, and combined type.  Combined type is the most common.\n\nIPMN presents clinically with diarrhea, pain, weight loss, acute pancreatitis and diabetes.  Typical age of onset is 60-80 y/o, more commonly in males.\n\nCT findings for branch pancreatic duct type include a thin, irregular and peripheral lobulated multicystic lesion (“grape-like” clusters).The main pancreatic duct type appears as a markedly dilated and tortuous main pancreatic duct.  Polypoid lesions may be seen lining the main duct.  The combined type appears as a multicystic lesion (commonly within the uncinate process) which is contiguous with a markedly dilated and tortuous main pancreatic duct. MRCP will show communication between the dilated duct and cystic lesions.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for IPMN includes chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, mucinous cystic neoplasm and serous cystadenoma.

Generally, main duct and combined duct types are resected in good surgical candidates.  Branch duct type IPMN without suggestion of invasive carcinoma may be monitored.

However, in order to detect small hiatal hernias, one must use high-resolution manometry.\n-Etiology-trauma, congenital malformation, and iatrogenic factors. \n-Prognosis-Most small hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. With larger type I hernias, the main clinical implication is the propensity to develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). \n\nType II, III, and IV: Paraesophageal hernias  — account for up to 5 percent of all hiatal hernias. \nEtiology: usually unclear, but a recognized complication of surgical dissection of the hiatus as occurs during antireflux procedures, esophagomyotomy, or partial gastrectomy.\n-Description: As the hernia enlarges, the greater curvature of the stomach rolls up into the thorax. Because the stomach is fixed at the gastroesophageal junction, the herniated stomach tends to rotate around its longitudinal axis, resulting in an organoaxial volvulus. \n-Diagnosis: barium swallow or endoscopy. If the hernia involves organs other than just the stomach, a definitive diagnosis is established with CT or MRI.\n\nTypes III and IV hiatal hernias are variants of the type II hernia:\n-Type III -with progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal membrane stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm. \n-Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal membrane, allowing other organs, such as the colon, spleen, pancreas, and small intestine, to enter the hernia sac. \n\nSYMPTOMS — usually discovered as a finding on upper gastrointestinal studies or endoscopy. \nType II-vague, intermittent symptoms, epigastric or substernal pain, postprandial fullness, substernal fullness, nausea, and retching. An upright radiograph of the thorax may be diagnostic, revealing a retrocardiac air-fluid level within a paraesophageal hernia or intrathoracic stomach. \n\nTREATMENT — Repair of an isolated, asymptomatic type I hiatal hernia is rarely indicated. If symptoms of GERD occur in association with a large hiatus hernia, either medical or surgical treatment is indicated to control the reflux.\nIn contrast, the enlarging types II, III, and IV hernias pose a constant risk of serious complications. These hernias never regress and progressively enlarge. If left untreated, the paraesophageal hernia eventually reaches the stage of the giant intrathoracic stomach, at which point the prognosis is poor and the complication rate is high.

It is typically a disease of young adults, with a peak incidence in the third decade. The diagnosis is suggested by a combination of consistent clinical and radiological findings along with the presence of some nonspecific features such as depressed delayed-type hypersensitivity, abnormal immunoglobulins, hypercalcaemia, and elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. It can be confirmed by biopsy evidence of widespread noncaseating granulomas. Pulmonary involvement accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with sarcoidosis. The disease has a worse prognosis in blacks than whites, with a greater tendency for chronicity and multiorgan involvement.\n\nAbout 90% of patients will have an abnormal chest radiograph at some stage, showing lymphadenopathy, parenchymal opacities, or both. Other findings are uncommon and seldom occur in isolation. Sarcoidosis is traditionally staged according to its appearance on the chest radiograph: stage I, lymphadenopathy; stage II, lymphadenopathy with parenchymal opacity; stage III, parenchymal opacity alone. Low stages at presentation carry a better prognosis than high stages. \n\nLymphadenopathy is evident on the chest radiograph in about 70–80% of patients at some time during the course of the condition. Sarcoidosis is characterized by bilateral, symmetrical hilar and paratracheal lymphadenopathy. In 90% of patients with lymphadenopathy, nodal enlargement is maximal on the first radiograph and usually disappears within 6–12 months. In about 5%, however, large nodes persist more or less indefinitely, and these can be a source of confusion when found later with other incidental chest pathology. Recurrence of lymphadenopathy is virtually unrecorded. The lymph nodes may calcify, sometimes in a characteristic eggshell fashion. This latter feature is shared by only a few conditions. \n\nAbout 40% of patients presenting with nodal enlargement will develop parenchymal opacities, usually within a year, and of these, about one third will go on to have persistent (fibrotic) shadowing. Nodal enlargement does not develop after parenchymal opacities have appeared.\n\nParenchymal changes probably occur histologically in all patients but are only detected on the chest radiograph in 50–70% of cases. They may be classified as reversible, nonreversible (fibrotic), and mixed. Changes may resolve completely (two thirds of cases) or in part, leaving irreversible fibrosis. There are three major patterns of reversible opacity: irregular or rounded 2-4mm nodules, patchy airspace consolidation, or rarely 1-4cm irregular nodules. Characteristically they appear as the nodal enlargement is subsiding, in contrast to lymphoma in which these abnormalities tend to progress in unison. \n\nParenchymal opacities are well demonstrated on high-resolution CT. High-resolution CT is very sensitive and the findings are frequently highly specific for sarcoidosis. The principal abnormality is 1–5 mm nodules distributed in a perilymphatic fashion, predominantly along the bronchovascular bundles and subpleurally and, to a lesser extent, along interlobular septa.\n\nOther manifestations of sarcoidosis include pleural thickening and effusions. These are unusual though and do not occur in isolation. \n\nCor pulmonale, mycetoma formation and pneumothorax are all recognized complications of this fibrotic stage.", "keywords": "SarcoidHRCT", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1114_synpic19630", "MPX1114_synpic19631", "MPX1114_synpic19632"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1114_synpic19630", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1114_synpic19630.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Axial CT demonstrates nodular interstitial lung disease with concurrent pulmonary masses and lymphadenopathy.", "age": "36", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "6.6", "figure_part": "b"}, {"image_id": "MPX1114_synpic19631", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1114_synpic19631.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Coronal reformatted CT demonstrates nodular interstitial lung disease with concurrent pulmonary masses and lymphadenopathy.", "age": "36", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "6.6", "figure_part": "c"}, {"image_id": "MPX1114_synpic19632", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1114_synpic19632.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Axial reformatted CT demonstrates nodular interstitial lung disease with concurrent pulmonary masses and lymphadenopathy.", "age": "36", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "6.6", "figure_part": "d"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n36 year-old Caucasian man with worsening shortness of breath, exercise intolerance and fatigue.

(1, 2)  Early days of LC demonstrated a higher incidence of bile duct injuries and biliary leak, and initially this phenomenon was attributed to the \"learning curve\", but there is increasing evidence that the \"learning curve\" may not be entirely the reason why this is so. (2)\n\nIn the literature, biliary leaks after LC occur in approximately 1% of patients.  In a series of 64 patients with leaks addressed with endoscopic evaluation (ERCP), the vast majority of the leaks (50) were from the cystic duct.  Other places of biliary leaks were the ducts of Luschka (4), common bile duct (6), and common hepatic duct (4). (5)\n\nScintigraphic evaluation of patients with potential biliary leaks after LC has been clearly established in the literature (3, 4).  Other anatomic modalities such as US or CT can demonstrate a fluid collection, and a bile leak can be suggested from history, but it would be difficult to actually demonstrate a leak via purely anatomic studies alone.  Scintigraphic evaluation with an agent such as Tc99m-disofenin, as in this case, will clearly demonstrate whether or not the fluid collection is indeed a leakage of bile from the biliary system.\n\nTreatment of biliary leaks in this setting can be done by percutaneous drainage, but the literature demonstrates increasing use of endoscopic evaluation, sphincterotomy, and possible stent placement.  The rationale is that by decreasing the resistance of the normal flow through the common bile duct and into the duodenum, the biliary leak will, in time, close itself.  Percutaneous drainage may be appropriate for patients with possible infection of the bile collection within the peritoneal cavity, which was suspected in this case.

Her long history of hypertension is likely the main factor leading to the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) noted.", "topic_title": "Intracerebral hemorrhage, chronic hypertension", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Hemorrhage", "disease_discussion": "Chronic hypertension causes fibrinoid necrosis in the penetrating and subcortical arteries, weakening of the arterial walls, and formation of small aneurysmal outpouchings, known as Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms.  These microaneurysms, predispose the patient to spontaneous ICH.  Bleeding is limited by the resistance of tissue pressure in the surrounding brain structures.  If the hematoma is large, distortion of structures and increased ICP may cause headache, vomiting, and decreased alertness. ICH accounts for 10 to 15 percent of all strokes in whites and about 30 percent in blacks and individuals of Asian origin.\n\nLocations of hypertensive ICHs are putamen (40%), lobar (22%), thalamus (15%), pons (8%), cerebellum (8%), and caudate (7%).\n\nThe differential diagnosis should include hypertension, bleeding diatheses (especially as a result of iatrogenic coumadin), trauma (subdural and epidural hematomas), and amyloid angiopathy as the most frequent causes.  Rarely, brain tumors and abscesses can have a rapid onset mimicking ICH.\n\nIn young, normotensive patients, especially those with lobar and intraventricular hemorrhages, vascular malformations (AVM) are the most likely source of bleeding.  \n\nSome primary and metastatic brain tumors, especially renal carcinoma and choriocarcinoma, can develop hemorrhages within the tumor.  The initial evaluation, should include CBC, chemistries, coagulation studies (PT, PTT, bleeding time, and platelet count), arterial blood gas analysis, and toxicology screen.\n\nCT scan should be performed immediately in patients suspected of having an ICH.  Follow-up CT should be performed to evaluate a change in clinical signs or mental status.\n\nPatients who have ICH after cocaine use have a high likelihood of vascular malformations and aneurysms and need angiography.Medical management involves reduction and maintenance of intracranial pressure.  Commonly, patients are intubated if they are unable to protect their airway.  Blood pressure swings may be controlled with IV labetolol (adequate intracranial perfusion pressure must be maintained).  As an adjunct, patients may be placed in the reverse-Trendelenberg position to assist in relieving increased intracranial pressure.\n\nRecent studies of hematoma removal have shown promise for open surgical decompression, but only if accomplished early after the onset of symptoms.  The best candidates for surgery may be patients with moderate to large hematomas who are still awake.  Neuroimaging techniques have made it possible to drain hematomas percutaneously, using stereotactic surgery. Survival depends on the location, size, and rapidity of development of the hematoma.  ICHs are at first soft and dissect along white matter fiber tracts.\n\nIf the patient survives the initial changes in ICP, blood is absorbed and a cavity or slit forms that may interrupt brain pathways.  Patients with small hematomas located deep and near midline structures often develop secondary herniation and mass effect, and these patients have a high mortality rate.  Survivors invariably have severe neurological deficits.  In patients with medium-sized hematomas, the deficit varies with the location and size of the hematomas.", "keywords": "Intracerebralhemorrhage", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1170_synpic19419", "MPX1170_synpic19421", "MPX1170_synpic19422", "MPX1170_synpic19423", "MPX1170_synpic19424", "MPX1170_synpic19425", "MPX1170_synpic19426", "MPX1170_synpic19427", "MPX1170_synpic19428"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1170_synpic19419", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1170_synpic19419.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - Montage", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "A single, large intraparenchymal hemorrhage is present within the right occipital lobe measuring 3x2cm with adjacent edema.

The differential considerations for a splenic cyst include post-traumatic, epidermoid cyst, abscess, hydatid cyst, infarction, splenic peliosis, and neoplasia, both benign and malignant.  80% of cases in North America are post-traumatic.  Direct surgical intervention in this case yielded a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst, as defined by the presence of an inner endothelial lining.\n\nSplenic cysts can remain stable in size for many years, or enlarge slowly, occasionally to massive proportion (as was the case with this patient).  The potential for rupture and hemorrhage increases with increasing size.  There is also a risk for secondary infection.  Optimal surgical management is not clearly defined, but a number of procedures are available for symptomatic or enlarging cysts.  Available options for those with non-parasitic cysts include percutaneous procedures (eg, biopsy, aspiration, drainage), or more direct surgical interventions such as decapsulation/cyst wall unroofing, partial or total splenectomy.

As is true with most neoplasms the cause is multifactorial.  A host of environmental and genetic factors combine in synergy to produce unregulated cell proliferation.  In the case of sporadic melanoma, exposure to ultraviolet B (290 to 320 nm) and ultraviolet A (320 to 400 nm) is the most significant environmental factor.  The most influential genetic component of this disease is a deletion or mutation in the p16INK4 gene.  Normally, this protein regulates cell proliferation by inhibiting the assembly of cyclin D/CDK 4/6 complex.   This genetic error occurs in 25 to 40 percent of sporadic melanomas. Other risk factors include, in decreasing order: past history of melanoma; family history of melanoma or dysplastic nevus; presence of large congenital nevi; presence of ten or greater dysplastic nevi; presence of 100 or greater common acquired nevi; fair skin; red hair; and high intermittent sun exposure. \n\nMalignant melanoma is the final lesion in a series of premalignant lesions that follow a predictable pattern of progression.  First, a normal melanocyte escapes keratinocyte control and becomes a nevus cell.  Next, the cell separates from the basement membrane and demonstrates cytologic atypia, thus becoming a dysplastic nevus cell.  Subsequently, the cell exhibits a radial growth phase, followed by a vertical growth phase.  The Breslow Depth (0.76 mm) is the most reliable predictor of the behavior of the primary lesion, so that the likelihood of metastatic transformation increases with the depth of vertical growth.  The ability to spread to distant sites is a function of the b3 subunit of the vitronectin receptor.\n\nEpidemiology: \nLancaster is credited with discovering a relationship between melanoma incidence and latitude.  As the distance to the equator decreases, the incidence and rate of melanoma mortality in whites increases.  Interestingly, there are 30 cases per 100,000 people in Australia.  Australia exhibits the highest melanoma incidence in the world because of its equatorial climate, fair-skinned population, and ozone depletion.  In the United States, the incidence has increased from 1 per 100,000 in 1935 to 15 per 100,000 in 1996.  In 1973, the mortality was 1.6 per 100,000 individuals; in 1996, the mortality rate was 2.3 per 100,000 individuals.  At present, melanoma ranks as the sixth most common cancer in American men, and the seventh most common cancer among American women.  The risk for developing melanoma among white Americans is 1 in 85.\n\nClinical Manifestations:\nCutaneous melanoma is distinguished by its asymmetry, diffuse borders, variegated color, diameter greater than 5 mm, and evolving morphology.  Ten percent of lesions ulcerate and bleed.  In a study of 84,000 with melanoma, 2.2% of all melanoma presented without signs of a primary lesion (Chang, Cancer 1998; 83: 1664).  These patients are usually younger than other melanoma patients, and they tend to be male.  The prognosis is similar to that of patients with known primary cutaneous melanoma.  The most common sites for metastasis are skin, lungs, liver, brain, and bone.\t\nBrain metastases are present in 8% to 46% of melanoma patients.\n\nDiagnosis:  \nLymph node core biopsy with subsequent immunohistochemical analysis provides a definitive diagnosis.  Ninety percent of melanomas are positive for S-100 antigen.  HMB-45 (Melanoma Associated Marker) is more specific for melanoma than S-100, but it is less sensitive.  Melanoma cells do not exhibit cytokeratin, leukocyte common antigen, or desmin.  \n\nTreatment:\nAt present, there is no cure for disseminated melanoma (Stage IV: M1).   Because brain metastases cause symptoms via compression of neural parenchyma, all therapy is geared toward reducing intracranial pressure.  This can be achieved via corticosteroids, gamma knife irradiation or conventional surgery (in the case of a solitary brain lesion), and/or whole brain radiotherapy (in the case of multiple lesions).  The pain associated with bone metastases is successfully treated by radiotherapy.", "keywords": "melanomaHMB-45vitronectin receptor b3 subunit", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1174_synpic18375", "MPX1174_synpic18376"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1174_synpic18375", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1174_synpic18375.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Routine non-contrast images of the brain demonstrate a 1.3 x 1.2 cm mass within the left optic nerve", "age": "79", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1174_synpic18376", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1174_synpic18376.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "A noncontrast axial CT Image of the brain demonstrate multiple diffuse hemorrhagic lesions with associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.

This tendency frequently results in bullets seen on radiographs pointing toward their direction of travel and entrance wound.\n\n\nThis case demonstrates an unusual path bringing up another unintuitive situation called bullet embolism, which is a rare but well documented phenomenon.  With bullet embolism, the bullet travels through vascular channels; however, in our patient, the bullet traveled through both an air-filled channel (the external auditory canal) and a vascular channel (the petrous carotid canal).

When a firearm missile enters a vascular structure, the projectile can pass through both walls of the vessel or settle within the wall or lumen.  If the latter occurs, the missile may be carried by the flow of blood to a new site resulting in an embolism (1,2,3).\nSymptomatic arterial emboli may result in peripheral ischemia and should be removed quickly to avoid tissue or neurologic damage.  Asymptomatic, cerebral, pulmonary, and pelvic arterial emboli may remain in place, especially if removal is technically difficult (3).

SDHs are to be anticipated along these structures since there is a continuation of the potential subdural space along these dural reflections.  Interhemispheric fissure and tentorial leaf SDHs are commonly seen in elderly trauma victims, especially if they are alcoholic.  The enlarged subarachnoid spaces of these patients may contribute to an excessive mobility of the brain and greater susceptibility of the interhemispheric/tentorial veins to traumatic injury.  \n\nAcute subdural hematomas can be classified as \"simple\" or \"complicated,\" depending on whether parenchymal brain injuries (contusions, intracerebral hematomas, diffuse axonal injury) are also present.  Notably, intra-axial injuries are much more common with acute SDHs than with either EDHs or chronic SDHs.  The majority of patients with acute SDHs, in fact, will have associated parenchymal brain injuries.  Secondary forms of brain injury (anoxic/ischemic injury, trans-tentorial/subfalcine/tonsilar herniation, increased intracranial pressure) are also quite common in patients with acute SDHs. \n\nAcute SDHs still carry a significant risk of morbidity and mortality.  The overall mortality of patients with acute SDHs is greater than that for any other traumatic intracranial mass lesion (ICH, EDH, focal contusion).  Despite modern therapy, the mortality is over 35% in all large series and greater than 50% in most reports.  A primary factor related to clinical outcome of patients with acute SDHs is the presence or absence of associated intraaxial lesions.  In one series of patients, the mortality of \"simple\" SDHs was 22% as compared to over 50% for those with \"complicated\" SDHs.  A second major factor significantly related to outcome is the presence and severity of mass effect.  Mass effect from a SDH may be due to a combination of factors; the hematoma itself, underlying parenchymal injury, intracerebral hematoma, and diffuse cerebral edema/swelling from a loss of vasomotor autoregulation.  The mass effect can produce injury to the brain through a generalized increase in intracranial pressure, global or localized impairment of blood flow, transtentorial/tonsilar herniation resulting in ischemic/pressure necrosis of the upper brain stem.

Inflammation of the pericardium (i.e. pericarditis) can be the result of many different etiologies.  The most common of these etiologies include infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal and TB), post-MI, association with malignancy (breast, lung, lymphoproliferative and melanoma), association with systemic disease (uremia, hypothyroidism and connective tissue disorders) and post-chest radiation exposure (Primack 1998). \n\nThe most common result of acute pericarditis is the formation of a pericardial effusion, which can be transudative or exudative depending on the underlying pathology.  Clinical signs of effusion include pericardial friction rub, chest pain, increased dullness over precordium and pulsus paradoxus.  Plain film diagnosis of pericardial disease is based on the observation of the changes in the contours of the heart borders contained by the pericardium (Rozenshtein 1999).  Radiographic signs of pericardial effusion include a smooth generalized increase in size of the cardiac silhouette without specific chamber enlargement, \"water-bottle\" or \"globular\" cardiac configuration and an anterior pericardial stripe thicker than 2 mm in the lateral view (Rozenshtein 1999).  \n\nPericardial effusion can progress to the point where diastolic filling of the ventricles is severely impeded and the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.  This condition is termed cardiac tamponade and is heralded clinically by Beck's triad, which includes muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins and hypotension.  Pulsus paradoxus is another clinical sign frequently seen in tamponade.  Because acute tamponade is possible with small effusions, plain films are not a sensitive technique for detecting clinically significant pericardial enlargement.  Subtle changes in cardiac contour may only be evident through comparison to prior films.  If there is cardiac enlargement with decreased pulmonary vasculature or if the azygous and SVC are dilated, one should have a high index of suspicion for tamponade (Rozenshtein 1999).", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2171_synpic20416"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2171_synpic20416", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2171_synpic20416.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Large pericardial effusion", "age": "19", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "55.821", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nPatient is a 19 year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant, with history of systemic lupus erythematosus.

These lesions typically present in young adults in the 2nd to 5th decade with complaints referable to acute or chronic hydrocephalus. Other symptoms include ataxia, memory disturbances, and gait disorders. The cyst contents include secretory and breakdown products of the epithelial lining tissue, including hemorrhage, lipid (cholesterol), hemosiderin, and CSF. \n\nOn T1-weighted MR images, these cysts vary widely from hypo- to hyperintense in comparison to normal brain. Although they may be bright on T2-weighted images, moderate to marked hypointensity is common and has been attributed to a very short T1 relaxation time or to magnetic susceptibility effect from paramagnetic substances in the cyst. On noncontrast MR, these lesions occasionally are indistinguishable by intensity from neoplasia; however, the absence of enhancement, classic location, and relative hypointensity on T2-weighted studies should suggest this diagnosis. Treatment is variable, including ventricular shunting alone, stereotactic cyst drainage, or surgical resection. \n\nOn noncontrast CT, colloid cysts are solitary, round to oval, usually hyperdense masses at the foramen of Monro with associated enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles (Film .3). Minimal or absent contrast enhancement is typical. Moderate enhancement with contrast suggests a different etiology, such as glioma, craniopharyngioma, choroid plexus papilloma, or remotely meningioma.

The specific etiology of sarcoidosis has not yet been identified, but it likely the combination of environmental and genetic factors. Events are triggered by an unknown factor with activation of pulmonary T cells and pulmonary alveolar macrophages. T cells proliferate in the lungs and release chemotactic factors which attract monocytes into the lungs, increasing the macrophage response which in turn leads to proliferation of fibroblasts with promotion of collagen synthesis and eventual fibrosis. Hypercalcemia and elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme are seen secondary to activation of pulmonary alveolar macrophages.  Hypercalcemia can lead to nephrocalcinosis. T cell changes in the lungs are not seen in the peripheral circulation where there is lymphopenia.  Manifestations are also seen in other organ systems. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is present in about 80% cases and is often asymptotic but may be associated with dull ache, malaise and fever. Generalized lymphadenopathy may occur in about 10%. Nervous system involvement includes cranial nerve palsies and neuropathy.  The eyes can be involved with uveitits and keratoconjuctivivits.  Skeletal manifestations include phalangeal cysts and arthritis.  The heart can be affected with cardiomyopathy and associated heart block.  In the united stated, sarcoid is more common in blacks. In blacks, the skin, joints, and eyes are more often involved.   Additionally, manifestation of the disease tends to be more florid in blacks.  \n\nRadiographic findings: Plain film CXR abnormalities are found in over 90% of patients.  Bilateral hilar adenopathy is most common, oftentimes with right paratracheal and AP window adenopathy. Subcarinal nodes are less common. Lymph nodes can calcify, usually in an amorphous, popcorn-like fashion.  Nodal calcification is related to duration of disease. Sarcoid causes interstitial lung disease, which can have a variety of appearances: a reticulo-nodular pattern is the most common and is typically bilateral and symmetric. An alveolar pattern with small indistinct nodular opacities can be seen but is actually the result of interstitial lung disease.\nCT is more sensitive in the detection of adenopathy and parenchymal lung disease.  HRCT is used to evaluate for parenchymal lung disease demonstrating nodular peribronchiovascular thickening.  Similar changes may be noted along the fissures.  Nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter are actually the result of coalescence of small nodules. Areas of ground glass attenuation can be seen resulting from microscopic interstitial granulomas. CT appearance does not correspond well to patient’s pulmonary state. Sarcoid can lead to end stage fibrosis, which is indistinguishable from other causes.  \nAbdominal involvement includes liver involvement which most commonly produces hepatomegaly, but can result in focal nodules.  Additionally, hypodense splenic nodules can be found.  Intra-abdominal adenopathy can be seen in nearly a 3rd of patients.  Nephrolithiasis can be seen from hypercalcemia. Skeletal findings tend to involve the small bones of the hands with associated skin changes. Findings include a lace-like reticular pattern or cystic lesions. The bone lesions are hot on bone scan and FDG PET imaging. \nCardiac changes can include thinning of the myocardium seen on CT.  On MRI, there can be areas of increased MRI T2 signal intensity and areas of T-1 contrast enhancement.\n\nStaging/prognosis: Staging is based upon the CXR findings. Stage 0- Normal CXR; Stage 1- Mediastinal/ Hilar adenopathy; Stage 2- Adenopathy plus parenchymal infiltrates; Stage 3- Lung infiltrates only; and Stage 4- Fibrosis/ Cystic changes. Prognosis is directly correlated with the patients staging.   Sarcoid will resolve in over half of stage 1 patients.  Overall, about 20% of affected patients will progress to pulmonary fibrosis with 5% mortality.\n\nTreatment: Usually no treatment is necessary. Spontaneous remission occurs in 90% of patients with stage 1 pulmonary disease and half of patients with stage 2.  If chest x-rays showed persistent pulmonary infiltration with associated decreased serial lung functions oral steroids are used.  In patients who are unresponsive to steroids, other medications such as azathioprine or cyclosporin may be useful.

These typically present as a posterior mediastinal mass at a median age of 0.9 years.  Other tumors arising from sympathetic ganglia include ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma, which more commonly occur in older children.\n\nThe clinical presentation of thoracic neuroblastoma is characterized by a variety of symptoms and signs, including fever, malaise, back pain, anemia, and respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.  Apical lesions may produce Horner's syndrome, and spinal canal involvement may cause lower limb weakness.  Rarely, patients may present with the opsoclonus cerebellar ataxia syndrome. That being said, approximately 50% of thoracic neuroblastomas are found incidentally on chest films. \n\nChest radiographs demonstrate a posterior mediastinal mass, which may be mistaken for pneumonia, atelectasis, or normal thymus. Rib erosion and costal separation may be evident. Calcification is often present and metastatic tumors are most often bilateral, paravertebral, and in the lower posterior mediastinum.  Computed tomography typically shows an inhomogeneously enhancing paraspinal mass. Approximately 40% of lesions show calcification, and extradural extension occurs in approximately 20%.  MRI is valuable in determining intraspinal extension, marrow involvement,  and chest wall and lymph node involvement.\n\nDiagnosis is made with biopsy of the lesion, and complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice.

Other associations include radiation exposure, asbestos exposure, occupational inhaled substances (especially nickel, chromates, and arsenic), genetically dominant oncogenes, and loss of tumor suppressor genes.\n\nDemographics (Age, Sex, Incidence): Cancer of the lung occurs most often between the ages of 40 and 70, with a peak incidence in the 6th or 7th decade. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes and the male:female death ratio is about 3:1. The annual death rate for lung cancer is about 70/100,000 for males and 19/100,000 for females.\n\nCommon Locations: Bronchogenic cancers arise most often as a hilar mass but may also present as a large peripheral mass.\n\nGross Appearance: The neoplastic tissue is typically gray-white and firm to hard.  Bulky tumors often have areas of necrosis that appear yellow-white and mottling. \n\nHistology: Histology varies depending on the subtype: adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype and features include gland formation, mucin production, and often an adjacent desmoplastic response.  Other subtypes include squamous cell carcinomas, small cell carcinomas, and large cell carcinomas.\n\nSpecial Stains: Mucicarmine, Cytokeratin 7, Cytokeratin 20, and TTF -1.\n\nRadiology: Plain chest films may show single or multiple nodules, well defined or poorly defined masses in the hilar or peripheral regions or no findings. Mediastinal enlargement may be evident due to primary tumor or metastatic lymphadenopathy.  CT may show an irregular or spiculated edge due to fibrosis surrounding the tumor, a lobulated contour, air bronchograms within the nodule, or cavitation. 95% of lung nodules exceeding 2 cm are cancers. \nOf particular significance for this case is the radiologic appearance of lung cancer metastases to the liver. A liver met will typically appear as a well-defined, low-density, solid mass with vague peripheral enhancement.  The mass will often appear hypodense centrally due to tumor necrosis.  Calcifications may be present. Multiple masses or diffusely infiltrating metastases may also occur.   \n\nProgression: Bronchogenic CA spreads by direct invasion or via the hematogeneous or lympahngitic routes.  Mediastinal nodes are commonly involved, and distal mets to the liver, brain, bone, and adrenals are common.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: Overall prognosis is approximately 9% 5 year survival. Small-cell carcinoma has a median survival rate of 12-18 months and is treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Non-small cell cancers are treated surgically if disease is limited.

In the United States, many patients with significant trauma are evaluated at a trauma center, resuscitated at that same center and receive definitive care all within one hospital.  In the military this is different as they may pass through many different facilities on their way back to the US for definitive care in a relatively short time.  A complete set of images may not always be available and the Radiologist must try to look at repeat scans to figure out what interventions may have been done prior to the patient’s arrival and what are the remaining complications.  Often the patients may not be aware of what surgeries they have had because they were unconscious and are unable to provide accurate histories.\n\nThis is illustrated in trying to follow the even number rule of GSW’s.  For each entrance wound, it is important to see either an exit wound or a bullet.  If we do not see a paired wound or bullet with an entrance wound it is important to keep searching because the bullet may have embolized or we are missing the exit wound.  In patients who have received care en-route it is possible to have a violation of this rule because the bullets may have been removed during previous surgeries at different facilities.\n\nThis patient had a repaired diaphragm laceration before reaching our facility which is evidence by 2 clips in the left hemi-diaphragm.  Penetrating diaphragm injuries tend to be smaller (length 1-2cm) and more subtle than blunt diaphragm injuries.  The signs used for detecting blunt diaphragm injury are not as useful in assessing penetrating diaphragm injuries.  One early and specific sign of PDI is herniation of abdominal fat through the injury into the thorax.  If a wound tract is seen on both sides of the diaphragm the specificity of this sign is reportedly 100% (sensitivity 36%).  The diaphragm can also be abnormally thickened when being compared to the contralateral hemidiaphragm due to hematoma, edema, or muscle retraction.  One must have a high index of suspicion when evaluation for penetrating diaphragm injuries.", "topic_title": "Penetrating Diaphragm Injury After Trauma", "acr_code": "4.4", "category": "Trauma", "disease_discussion": "Typically, penetrating diaphragm injury is difficult to diagnose without a high index of suspicion.  Penetrating diaphragm injuries (PDI) tend to be smaller than blunt diaphragm injuries.  PDI’s typically are ≤1-2 cm in length.  Diaphragm injuries are most easily diagnosed at laparotomy but not all patients have indications for an initial laparotomy.\n\nIn trauma, a chest radiograph is typically the first imaging modality employed.  This can be helpful in the initial evaluation for inspecting the integrity of the hemi-diaphragms but patient positioning and the quality of portable films can limit their usefulness.  Many patients with trauma ultimately undergo a CT study.  Multiplanar reconstructed images have been reported by some to be helpful in detecting diaphragm injuries.  There are fewer studies on the use of CT with PDI, one small study by Larici, et al. reported a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 79% of detecting PDI’s with helical CT.  \n\nHerniation of abdominal fat into the thorax is one sign that is commonly used to detect blunt diaphragm rupture can still be used when looking for PDI.

First described in 1929 by Kling, Holmgren demonstrated the “fat-fluid” level radiographically in 1939 [1,2].  In 1942, Pierce et al. described a fat-fluid level, which had a fluid-fluid component and suggested that this phenomenon was the result of separation of blood into serum and cellular elements [2].  In 1996, Lugo-Olivieri et al. performed a retrospective review of 41 patients with tibial plateau fractures and found that joint effusions with fluid levels resulted from blood separating into cellular elements and supernatant serum, confirmed with CT or MR imaging. Lugo-Olivieri concluded that a single fluid-fluid level on radiographs in a post-traumatic knee did not necessarily reflect lipohemarthrosis, as hemarthrosis could appear similarly.  They suggested that a double fluid-fluid level is a more specific finding for intraarticular fat and an underlying fracture.\n\nLipohemarthrosis is more common in fractures about the knee, but has been described in the shoulder, elbow, and hip fractures [1].  CT and MRI are more specific than radiography in evaluating the composition of the effusion, but sonography may also have a role [1].  The anterior layer on ultrasound will appear hyperechogenic because of the fat. On CT, this area will be fat-density, and will follow fat signal on all MR pulse sequences [1,2].  The supernatant layer will be anechoic on US, fluid density on CT, and follow simple fluid signal on all MR sequences [1,2].

Additionally, any immunocompromised patient may be affected; organ recipients on immunosuppressive treatment, oncologic and hematologic patients, the elderly, severely malnourished children, and patients requiring prolonged corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe most common radiographic finding in patients with PCP consists of diffuse, bilateral symmetric ground-glass reticulonodular, or finely granular opacities occurring in a perihilar, or lower lung zone distribution.  Less commonly, PCP will occur with upper lobe predominance.  If untreated, these opacities may manifest as diffuse air space consolidation. As the disease progresses, interstitial disease will become more pronounced, and air cysts may be noticed in 5% to 35% of patients.  Occasionally, single or multiple nodules, miliary nodules, cavitation, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, and pleural effusion will be identified.  CT typically demonstrates symmetric bilateral ground-glass opacities, which may be diffuse, or have a mosaic pattern with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung giving a “crazy-paving” pattern. Spontaneous pneumothorax may be identified in 5% to 10% of patients, and is more common when cysts are present.   Pneumomediastinum may also be evident occurring by itself or in concert with pneumothorax.\n\nMost patients have characteristic radiographic findings of PCP, eliminating the need for CT.  However, in patients with symptoms and atypical radiographic findings, CT may show ground-glass opacities, that when correlated with the CD4+ count and other clinical markers may allow the correct diagnosis of PCP to be made.  Other causes of ground-glass opacities in patients with AIDS include CMV pneumonia and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.\n\nClinically, patients with PCP demonstrate nonspecific complaints.  Fever, cough, progressive dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, night sweats, and chest pain are all common symptoms.  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are frequently elevated, and patients demonstrate restrictive patterns on pulmonary function tests, with hypoxemia when exercising.  Clinicians may employ induced sputums, or use bronchoscopy with BAL to clinch the diagnosis.  BAL which has close to 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity in diagnosing PCP, is useful when positive, however when results are negative, transbronchial or open lung biopsy may be pursued when the clinical findings suggest a high probability of PCP.  Patients will often begin empirical therapy in the absence of definitive diagnosis to avoid potential complications.\n\nSummary: Perihilar and bilateral lower lobe reticular opacities on chest radiography in a patient with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 suggests PCP.", "keywords": "Pneumocystis jiroveci PneumoniaPCPAIDS defining illness", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1957_synpic41668", "MPX1957_synpic41669", "MPX1957_synpic41670", "MPX1957_synpic41671", "MPX1957_synpic41676", "MPX1957_synpic41677"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1957_synpic41668", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1957_synpic41668.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Unenhanced CT of the chest on admission demonstrates diffuse multilobar ground-glass opacities with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung, with interstitial thickening in a predominately lower-lobe distribution.", "age": "60", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "6.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1957_synpic41669", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1957_synpic41669.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Unenhanced CT of the chest on admission demonstrates diffuse multilobar ground-glass opacities with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung, with interstitial thickening in a predominately lower-lobe distribution.", "age": "60", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "6.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1957_synpic41670", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1957_synpic41670.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Unenhanced CT of the chest on admission demonstrates diffuse multilobar ground-glass opacities with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung, with interstitial thickening in a predominately lower-lobe distribution.", "age": "60", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "6.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1957_synpic41671", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1957_synpic41671.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Unenhanced CT of the chest on admission demonstrates diffuse multilobar ground-glass opacities with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung, with interstitial thickening in a predominately lower-lobe distribution.", "age": "60", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "6.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1957_synpic41676", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1957_synpic41676.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "On hospital day 10, the patient experienced worsening respiratory distress and an unenhanced CT of the chest was performed.

This CT appearance was described by Kuhlman et al(1) in patients with invasive aspergillosis. In severely neutropenic patients, the CT halo sign is highly suggestive of infection by an angioinvasive fungus, most commonly Aspergillus. Vascular invasion by this fungus results in thrombosis of small- to medium-sized vessels, which causes ischemic necrosis. At pathologic examination, the nodules represent foci of infarction, and the halo of ground-glass attenuation results from alveolar hemorrhage. Although it is less common, the halo sign may also be observed in nonhemorrhagic nodules, in which case either tumor cells or inflammatory infiltrate account for the halo of ground-glass attenuation. Nonetheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, the halo sign is considered early evidence of pulmonary aspergillosis even before serologic tests become positive, and it warrants the administration of systemic antifungal therapy(2).\n\nEarly recognition of this complication is critical because this disease is associated with a high mortality rate that ranges from 50% to 90%.  The frequency of the halo sign in patients with invasive aspergillosis is relatively high in the early stages of the disease, but alters with time and becomes progressively less frequent.

Radiographic findings believed to be suggestive of appendicitis include rightward scoliosis, soft tissue masses, localized ileus, bowel obstruction, calcified fecolith, and free peritoneal fluid.  Of these features, the most specific for appendicitis is a calcified fecolith (appendicolith) found in up to 13% to 22% with appendicitis and in only 1% to 2% of those without (Rothrock).  While often recommended, these films rarely altered a patient\\'s diagnosis or management.       Ultrasonography is appropriate in patients in which the diagnosis is unclear by history and physical examination, especially in pediatric and female patients.  A normal appendix must be identified to rule out appendicitis.  An inflamed appendix usually measures greater than 6 mm in diameter, is non-compressible and tender with focal compression (Hardin).  Numerous other right lower quadrant conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cecal diverticulitis, Meckel\\'s diverticulum, endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease can cause false-positive ultrasonography results (Hardin).       Appendiceal CT is more accurate than ultrasound and consists of a focused, helical CT after a Gastrografin-saline enema.  It can be performed and interpreted usually within an hour.  The accuracy of CT is due in part to its ability to identify a normal appendix better than ultrasound.  If appendiceal CT is not available, standard abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast remains useful and may still be more accurate than ultrasound (Hardin).     The standard for management of appendicitis remains appendectomy.  The procedure may be performed by laparotomy (usually through a small right lower quadrant incision) or laparoscopy.  While laparoscopic intervention is advantageous in adults due to decreased postoperative pain, earlier return to normal activity and better cosmetic results, an open appendectomy remains the primary approach to treatment in children due to their smaller size (Rothrock).\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15155894", "keywords": "appendicitis", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2500_synpic23570", "MPX2500_synpic23571", "MPX2500_synpic23573"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2500_synpic23570", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2500_synpic23570.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "The  appendix  is strikingly enlarged.

Of these only the lipoma would be soft enough to be flattened by abdominal compression.  The absence of an associated exoenteric mass would be against the diagnosis of carcinoid, a more frequently found small bowel tumor.  Lack of ulceration together with the softness of the tumor would be against a leiomyoma, a slightly more frequent small bowel tumor than a lipoma.  The benign character of this tumor is supported by the long history and its smoothly round surface appearance.\n\nThe benign character of the tumor would have been rendered definite if lack of significant growth could have been shown by a further examination one or two years later.  This could be demonstrated in another case included here to underline this point.  Film .3 is a small bowel meal study done at another hospital in a patient who complained of intermittent pain.  Arrows outline an oval shaped, smooth intraluminal tumor.  The patient's symptoms continued and a small bowel enema was done two years later.  Film .4 demonstrates the same elongated intraluminal lesion which had not appreciably increased in size during the two years; a lipoma was removed at surgery.\n\nAll benign small bowel tumors are rare, leiomyoma and lipoma being the least infrequent.  Though lipomas arise in submucosal fat, their slow growth is deflected by the muscularis and directed into the bowel lumen to make them present like a mucosal polyp.  They will occasionally ulcerate and bleed.  More frequently, they will transiently intussuscept to give rise to crampy abdominal pain, the symptoms of the first patient in this case.  The diagnosis of lipoma can be supported by CT when it would show an attenuation number compatible with fat.\n\nFURTHER CASE EXAMPLE:  A 50-year-old man complained of crampy abdominal pain of sudden onset; stools were heme positive; a small bowel enema (Film .5) outlined an almost 2-cm rounded, intraluminal filling defect with slight surface irregularity (arrow) seen at the top of the film; in the course of the barium study (Film .6) the lesion was seen to intussuscept and advance about 4 cm (arrows indicate the narrow passage through the intussusception).

Its formation is secondary to failure of involution of the thyroglossal duct and persistent secretion of epithelial cells lining the duct. They can occur anywhere along the route of descent of the thyroglossal duct. Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common congenital neck lesion, being three times as common as branchial cleft cyst.\n\nThyroglossal duct cysts most commonly present at a doughy compressible painless neck mass along the midline or paramedian in a child or young adult. 90% present at less than 10 years of age. Other signs and symptoms include recurrent appearance of neck mass with upper respiratory tract infections or trauma.  Often, the patient will have a history of multiple prior incision & drainage procedures for “neck abcess”.  A rapidly enlarging mass suggests either infection of associated differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  Any associated nodularity or chunky calcification suggests associated thyroid carcinoma.\n\nA thyroglossal duct cyst presents as a midline cystic neck mass imbedded within the infrahyoid strap muscles, “claw sign”. 50% of the time they are found at the level of the hyoid bone, 25% on the infrahyoid neck and 25% timed at the suprahyoid neck. There usually to 2-4 cm in size and are round or ovoid. On contrast-enhanced CT it appears low density mass, occasionally with internal septations and a thin rim of peripheral enhancement.

The blood supply is anomalous, arising from the systemic circulation (ie. the aorta or bronchial arteries ). By definition, there is no typical communication with the bronchial tree or with the pulmonary arteries. Intralobar and extralobar discrimination is based primarily upon venous drainage, and the presence of an independent pleural lining (as in the extralobar type). The intralobar variant drains to the pulmonary veins or left atrium, the extralobar type to the systemic venous system (the inferior vena cava or the azygous system). Both gain blood supply from the systemic arterial circulation, frequently from below the diaphragm, and identification of this confirms the diagnosis (although failure to identify the arterial supply does not exclude it).  \n\nIn comparison, intralobar sequestrations usually become manifest during adolescence or adulthood, whereas extralobar sequestrations present at birth or soon thereafter (or may be suspected based upon prenatal ultrasonography). Intralobar sequestrations are three times more common with a male predominance, and a much lower incidence of associated anomalies (10% with associated skeletal, foregut, or diaphragmatic anomalies).  Extralobar sequestrations may have associated anomalies in up to 65% of patients, including diaphragmatic defects, pulmonary hypoplasia, bronchogenic cysts, and cardiac anomalies.  Intralobar sequestrations present with recurrent pneumonias, chronic cough, or dyspnea, or may be completely asymptomatic. Other complications of intralobar sequestrations include hemoptysis, and intrathoracic hemorrhage, and where there is marked vascular shunting, cardiac decompensation.  Extralobar sequestrations, presenting at birth or infancy, may manifest as cyanosis, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and recurrent pneumonias. Both predominantly are located in the left base in 60-90%.

(Hellstrom et al 2004)", "topic_title": "Hiatal Hernia", "acr_code": "7.9", "category": "Hernia/herniation", "disease_discussion": "In the United States and Canada, a large proportion of adults undergoing upper gastrointestinal barium radiographs are found to have a small hiatal hernia. About 90% to 95% of hiatal hernias found by radiograph are sliding hernias, and the rest are paraesophageal or mixed.  Most sliding hiatal hernias are small and of little clinical significance. Patients with symptomatic paraesophageal hernias are most often middle-aged to elderly.  Many patients with small, simple sliding hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. The main clinical significance of the sliding hiatal hernia is its contribution to gastroesophageal reflux . In addition to heartburn and regurgitation, patients with large sliding hiatal hernias may complain of dysphagia or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen. In a prospective, population-based study the risk of iron-deficiency anemia was found to be increased  in adults with hiatal hernia. On chest radiograph a hiatal hernia may be noted as a soft tissue density in the retrocardiac area. Hiatal hernias are most often diagnosed on upper gastrointestinal barium radiographic studies. At endoscopy the gastroesophageal junction is noted to be proximal to the impression of the diaphragm. [1]\n\nPatients with paraesophageal and mixed hiatal hernias are rarely completely asymptomatic if closely questioned. About half of patients with paraesophageal hernias have gastroesophageal reflux. Other symptoms include dysphagia, chest pain, vague postprandial discomfort, and shortness of breath. A substantial number of patients have chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. If the hernia is complicated by gastric volvulus, acute abdominal pain and retching will occur, often progressing rapidly to a surgical emergency. A paraesophageal or mixed hiatal hernia may be seen on chest radiograph as an abnormal soft tissue density (often with a gas bubble) in the mediastinum. Upper gastrointestinal radiograph is the best diagnostic study. [1]\n\nHiatal hernias are occasionally complicated by volvulus. The stomach is normally fixed in position by ligamentous attachments to the duodenum, spleen, liver, and diaphragm. Laxity of these ligaments, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, adhesions, gastric tumor, or masses in adjacent organs may predispose to volvulus. In about one third of cases the volvulus occurs below the diaphragm. In the other two thirds of cases volvulus occurs above the diaphragm in association with a diaphragmatic hernia. Sliding hiatal hernias are not associated with gastric volvulus.  Gastric volvulus may be mesenteroaxial or organoaxial. In about 60% of cases gastric volvulus is organoaxial: the stomach twists along its long axis. This axis usually passes through the gastroesophageal and gastropyloric junctions. The antrum rotates anteriorly and superiorly, the fundus posteriorly and inferiorly, twisting the greater curvature at some point along its length. This type of volvulus is commonly associated with a diaphragmatic hernia. Organoaxial volvulus is usually an acute event. Vascular compromise and gastric infarction may occur. The other major type of gastric volvulus is mesenteroaxial, in which the stomach folds on its short axis running across from the lesser curvature to the greater curvature, and the antrum twists anteriorly and superiorly. [1]\n\nSimple sliding hiatal hernias do not require treatment. Patients with symptomatic giant sliding hiatal hernias, paraesophageal, and mixed hernias should be offered surgery. Many experts suggest that surgery should be offered to patients with asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias, because about 30% of these patients will develop complications if left untreated. Many surgeons routinely perform a fundoplication on all repairs, both to prevent postoperative reflux esophagitis and to fix the stomach in the abdomen. Less commonly a gastrostomy is used to fix the stomach in position. Patients with sliding hiatal or paraesophageal hernias may have shortening of the esophagus. This makes it difficult to restore the gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragm without tension. In such cases an extra length of neoesophagus can be constructed from the proximal stomach (Colles-Nissen procedure). Paraesophageal and mixed hernias can be repaired through the chest or abdomen, with open or laparoscopic techniques. Compared with open repair, laparoscopic repair is associated with less blood loss, fewer overall complications, shorter hospital stay, and quicker return to normal activities. Long-term results are probably equal with either approach. Potential surgical complications include esophageal and gastric perforation, pneumothorax, and liver laceration. Potential long-term complications may include dysphagia if the wrap is too tight or gastroesophageal reflux if the fundoplication breaks down or migrates into the chest. Recurrence rates are about 10 [1]\n \n\n1.

Additionally, a non-contrast CT performed 1 month ago showed increased thickness of the pancreatic head.  A pre- and post-contrast CT were obtained to evaluate for change.\n\nThis is a presumptive diagnosis of diffuse fatty liver disease.  The causes for which are many, for instance, alcoholism, obesity, malnutrition, steroid therapy, and diabetes mellitus. Laboratory testing of liver function tests could aid in further diagnosis.  CT imaging is consistent with this diagnosis as the liver appears less dense than the spleen.  Given that the liver findings were discovered incidentally and the patient has been asymptomatic there is no need to aggressively pursue this with further imaging or biopsy.  However, from a medical record review, the patient reported that her primary care manager requested that she be taken off acetaminophen because of high liver function tests.  The results of this test were unavailable. So significant delay in diagnosis could lead to long-term liver damage.  Furthermore, most cases of fatty liver disease will resolve if the etiology is discovered and the offending agent is removed.\n\nThe appearance of focal fatty sparing is concerning and could misinterpreted as liver tumor, primary of metastasis.  In this case, the focal sparing is in a triangular shape near the portal vein which is consistent with fat sparing and not a mass.  \n\nAccessory lobes of liver are normal variant and if asymptomatic require no intervention.", "topic_title": "Hepatic fatty infiltration with focal sparing", "acr_code": "7.3", "category": "Metabolic (see also Toxic)", "disease_discussion": "Fatty metamorphosis is a common metabolic response of the liver to a variety of inciting agents and disease states.  These agents and states include corticosteroids, chemotherapy, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hepatotoxic drugs, obesity, severe hepatitis, chronic alcoholism, malnutrition / malabsorption, jejuno-ileal and jejunocolic bypass surgery, hyperalimentation, congestive heart failure, and blunt hepatic trauma.  Despite these associations, the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms remain obscure.  Possibly diminished portal venous perfusion has a significant effect on producing fatty change and altering hepatic density.  A relative hepatocellular ischemia is proposed to result in decreased parenchymal glycogen and increased accumulations of fat.  The fat content of the liver may rise as high as 40% - 50% of the weight, well above the normal value of approximately 5%.\nRegional variation in amount of liver-cell fat can produce entities called pseudolesions or pseudotumors, usually discovered during imaging. Focal fatty sparing in an otherwise fatty liver  occurs in several typical locations: along the gallbladder fossa, along the falciform ligament, occasionally in the periphery of the liver and near the hilum which is perfused with low-insulin blood from a pyloric vein. Because focal fatty sparing can only occur in the presence of fatty liver disease, most of these patients have a history of one of the disease states or agent exposures mentioned above.\n\nClassic features that will help differentiate focally fatty sparing from a hypoechoic mass are that it occurs in these typical locations, often has a geographic (triangular or quadrangular) shape vice being round like most masses and focally fatty sparing, since it is not a mass, will not demonstrate mass effect on adjacent structures, particularly crossing vessels.", "keywords": "Hepatic fatty infiltration with focal sparingLiver fatty infiltrationfocal sparing", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1056_synpic41083", "MPX1056_synpic41084"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1056_synpic41083", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1056_synpic41083.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Abdomen", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Large, diffusely infiltrated fatty liver with accessory left lobe.

Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas arise from the degeneration of the subependymal nodules.  They enhance moderately, show high signal intensity on T2WI, and are located at the foramina of Monroe.  These astrocytomas typically cause hydrocephalus and show a low rate of calcification.  However, these astrocytomas only occur in 1.7 to 15% of cases.  \n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\nDifferential diagnosis of giant cell astrocytoma is central neurocytoma, ependymoma, subependymoma, and a colloid cyst.\n  \nTreatment:\nResection of the GCA or shunting to treat hydrocephlaus.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1695_synpic21567"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1695_synpic21567", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1695_synpic21567.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "multiple calcifications", "age": "33", "sex": "N/A", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\ntest case for TS\n\nImaging Findings:\nmuliple parenchymal calcifications", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

Osteopoikilosis displays an autosomal dominant mode of transmission.\n\nClinical manifestations are absent or mild. In approximately 25% of cases, osteopoikilosis is associated with a specific syndrome such as mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia (coexistence of two or more of melorheostosis, osteopoikilosis, and osteopathia striata), Buschke-Ollendorf syndrome (osteopoikilosis and connective tissue nevi -dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata), and Gunal-Seber-Basaran syndrome (osteopoikilosis and dacrocystitis).  Additionally, dwarfism, dystocia, and spinal stenosis are other associations.\n\nRadiographic findings are diagnostic.  Numerous, small, well-defined, homogeneous ovoid or circular foci of increased density are clustered in a symmetric distribution in the epiphyses of long bones in a periarticular distribution or throughout smaller bones, such as the carpal and tarsal bones.  The sclerotic foci can also occur throughout the pelvis and vertebrae, and may increase in size with age until skeletal maturity is reached.

The symmetric distribution, the predilection for the epiphyses and metaphyses, and the uniform size of the sclerotic foci suggest osteopoikilosis.

Capsular disruption and intraperitoneal hemorrhage is often present. The mortality, which is relatively high (10-25%), is usually due to either an associated injury or an uncontrollable hemorrhage from a laceration or a central burst that involves the major hepatic veins and/or the intrahepatic or retrohepatic inferior vena cava. These latter patients rarely come to CT because of instability. Contrast-enhanced CT is the procedure of choice for evaluating hepatic injuries in stable patients. It can define the extent of injury, detect associated injuries and roughly quantitate the amount of hemoperitoneum. The amount of hemoperitoneum does not always correlate with clinical stability and the need for immediate surgery. Fairly large hepatic injuries may be missed without intravenous contrast enhancement. Conversely, small hematomas may be visible as densities on a non-contrast scan (and obscured by contrast-enhanced parenchyma). These are usually not clinically significant and preliminary non-contrast CT may be safely omitted when you are pressed for time. If non-operative management is chosen, CT or sonography can be used for follow-up. The liver injuries likely to be encountered on CT include contusions, subcapsular and parenchymal hematomas, lacerations and fractures. Contusions are ill-defined intraparenchymal lucencies. Subcapsular hematomas are lenticular lucent peripheral collections that indent the liver contour. Intraparenchymal hematomas are rounded or slightly irregular lucent collections.  Fresh and clotted blood is hyperdense on non-contrast scans as opposed to its hypodense appearance after contrast.

Most patients will have an acute clinical presentation.  The blood will, therefore, be hyperdense (white) on a plain CT scan.  The most common source of bleeding is a laceration or tear in one of the meningeal arteries that feed the dura itself.  Posterior or occipital epidurals may develop from lacerations of the dural transverse sinus.\n\nMore than 90% of patients with an EDH will have a skull fracture (and associated scalp trauma) in addition to the EDH.  The temporal bone and the underlying middle cranial fossa are the most commonly affected areas. Because of the firm fixation of the dura to the suture, the hematoma only rarely crosses a cranial suture.\n\nSome patients are knocked unconscious by the initial head impact (a \"concussion\") - but then wake up and may appear normal.  This is often described as the \"lucid interval\" and occurs in about 40% of patients with epidural hematoma.\n\nDr. Paul Cooper, in his book \"Head Injury\", reports these five patterns of the clinical EDH:(U=unconscious; L=lucid; C=conscious)\n\n1. U-->L-->U: 11 to 67%\n2. U throughout: 19 to 56%\n3. U-->C: 16 to 26%\n4. C-->U: 7 to 21%\n5. C throughout: 9 to 25%\n6. unknown or unstated: 5%\n\nNOTE: A significant number of patients do not even have a transient loss of consciousness. (Data courtesy of Vern Armbrustmacher).\n\nAs the blood accumulates from bleeding meningeal arteries, it forms a bi-convex or lens shaped mass that pushes the brain inward and downward - causing brain herniation.\n\nThe acute formation of the EDH often causes secondary downward transtentorial brain herniation.  This, in turn, may cause neurologic signs,including oculomotor nerve (CNN-3) dysfunction and a \"blown pupil\" (fixed and dilated).\n\nMany patients have the injury, but appear to be alright afterwards.  As the blood accumulates and the brain begins to shift, they may slip into a coma.  This is \"lucid interval\" is also sometimes described as \"Talk and Die\".  Sadly, this is not rare, and in 2009 Tony Award winning actress Natasha Richardson died from an epidural hematoma.

An enlarged paratracheal stripe (>5mm) is an important marker for otherwise subtle adenopathy, as well as tracheal tumor, mediastinal inflammation or hemorrhage, pleural thickening or pleural effusion.  The margins of the paratracheal stripe are: \n1. distal end—formed by the azygous vein\n2. medial margin—the air-soft tissue interface along the right mucosal surface of the trachea\n3. outer margin—begins around the medial end of the clavicle and is formed by the RUL plural surface\nThe stripe ends where the RUL bronchus goes under the azygous vein as it arches anteriorly to empty into the SVC.\nThe malignant lymphomas are divided into Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s groups.  Sir Thomas Hodgkin was the first to describe Hodgkin’s disease in 1932.  Hodgkin’s can present at any age, but it is more prevalent among adolescents and young adults.  It typically presents as painless, rubbery lymphadenopathy involving the superficial lymph node groups.  Cervical nodes are involved nearly 70% of the time.  Approximately half of patients also have splenomegaly.  Mediastinal involvement occurs in approximately 10% of patients, and mediastinal involvement is characteristic of the Nodular Sclerosing type (as in this patient).  Cutaneous involvement can occur and is usually a late complication.  Patients may also present with constitutional symptoms (night sweats, pruritis, fatigue, weight loss, etc) with widespread disease.  \nThe diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease is made by lymph node biopsy (as was done in this patient).  There are 4 histological types:\n1.\tNodular Sclerosing (>50%, most common; worst prognosis)\n2.\tMixed cellularity (25%)\n3.\tLymphocyte predominant (5%; best prognosis)\n4.\tLymphocyte depleted (5%)\nStaging of Hodgkin’s disease is made by the use of CXR, BM biopsy, and CT imaging.  There are 4 stages:\n1.\tStage I—confined to one lymph node group (90% 5-yr survival rate)\n2.\tStage II—confined to 2 or more lymph node groups on one side of the diaphragm\n3.\tStage III—involving nodes on both sides of the diaphragm\n4.\tStage IV—Extra-nodal disease (60% 5-yr survival rate) \nTreatment involves radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.  Patients with Stage I or Stage II Hodgkin’s disease are usually treated by radiation therapy, while Stage III & IV disease is usually treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nReferences:\n1.

Plain films will usually exhibit a duplex kidney which is longer than the nonduplex kidney (1-3 cm longer), but this is nonspecific.  Excretory urography may further characterize the renal anatomy and delineate anomalies, but may also prove difficult in discerning obstruction versus renal mass.  The use of ultrasound may show the presence of two collecting systems with intervening parenchyma, but does not rule out an intrarenal mass.  CT, however,  is useful in detecting obstruction and further characterizing the renal parenchyma.  It may also be valuable in illustrating partial versus complete duplication of ureters and ureter insertion points in the bladder.

Close inspection demonstrates the small size of the superior aspect or final turn of the cochlea.  Only the internal architecture is different.  Inspection of the semicircular canals is important since the can also be abnormally dilated (as in this case).", "topic_title": "Mondini Deformity.", "acr_code": "1.1", "category": "Congenital, malformation", "disease_discussion": "In the original scientific report written in Latin by Carlo Mondini in 1791, titled The Anatomic Section of a Boy Born Deaf, translated to English by Gordon J. Hartley in the American Journal of Otology, the inner ear anomaly described by Mondini consisted of:\n\n1) a cochlea of one-and-one-half turns instead of the normal two-and-one-half turns, comprising a normal basal turn and a cystic apex in place of the distal one-and-one-half turns; \n2) an enlarged vestibule with normal semicircular canals; and \n3) an enlarged vestibular aqueduct containing a dilated endolymphatic sac.  \n\nThus, the cochlear anomaly was relatively mild, and would correspond to incomplete partition in the spectrum of congenital cochlear malformation because of an arrest of embryogenesis.  Arrests at earlier stages in the spectrum include cochlear hypoplasia and common cavity and cochlear aplasia. Even earlier arrests result in otocyst and complete labyrinthine aplasia (Michel's anomaly).\n\nThe most common of the congenital cochlear deformities is Mondini's defect, which occurs late in auditory embryologic development, usually at 7 to 8 weeks.  The scala separations of the lumen of the cochlea are not developed completely at this point.  Essentially, Mondini's defect is incomplete development of the two-and-a-half turns of the cochlea.  The basal turn is relatively well formed, but the middle and apical turns are malformed.  Variations in the number of remaining turns in the cochlea comprise various types of otic dysplasia.  Enlargement of the vestibule is not an uncommon finding with cochlear abnormalities.  Enlargement of the endolymphatic sac in association with a large vestibular aqueduct is present in about 20% of Mondini malformations. \n\nRadiologically, the anomaly was recognized on polytomography by Jensen as early as 1969. Subsequently, he also described a more severe type of deformity consisting of an amorphous cochlear sac continuous with a dilated vestibule, for which he suggested the term \"dysplasia\". Unfortunately, the term \"Mondini dysplasia\" has come to mean virtually any congenital malformation of the osseous labyrinth detectable on radiographic examination.\n\nA recent retrospective review of temporal bone high-resolution CT findings was performed because it was realized that the term Mondini deformity was being used to describe two different types of incomplete partition of the cochlea. By taking inner ear measurements on radiologic findings they confirmed the presence of two different types of incomplete partition: IP-I (unpartitioned cochlea, cystic cochleovestibular malformation) and IP-II (incompletely partitioned cochlea, the classic Mondini deformity).\n\nIncomplete partition type I (unpartitioned cochlea, cystic cochleovestibular malformation) is defined as a malformation in which the cochlea lacks the entire modiolus and interscalar septa, resulting in a cystic appearance and there is an accompanying grossly dilated vestibule. Cochlear measurements show no significant difference from normal.\n\nThe type I malformation is less differentiated than the type II malformation.  Classic Mondini deformity has three components (a cystic apex, dilated vestibule, and large vestibular aqueduct), whereas type I malformation has an empty, unpartitioned cochlea and dilated vestibule without an enlarged vestibular aqueduct.  Classic Mondini deformity represents a later malformation, so the degree of dysplasia is milder than that in type I.", "keywords": "Mondinicochleavestibular", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2558_synpic20826", "MPX2558_synpic20827", "MPX2558_synpic20828", "MPX2558_synpic20829", "MPX2558_synpic20830", "MPX2558_synpic20831", "MPX2558_synpic20832"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2558_synpic20826", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2558_synpic20826.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "View of left cochlea.

When these findings occur unilaterally, and without vertebral involvement, the disorder is often referred to as hemifacial microsomia.

The heart, limbs and kidneys can also be affected within this spectrum.\n\n     Goldenhar syndrome is believed to occur randomly without an any genetic cause, although research into a multifactoral inheritance pattern is ongoing.

They may be found in intracranial and intraspinal compartments.  In the head, meningiomas are most commonly located in frontal, parasagittal, and parietal convexities (50% of cases). Less than 10% of tumors are infratentorial; multiple meningiomas occur less than 10% of the time.  Clinical presentation is varied, depending on particular structures compressed by the mass. Headache and visual changes are frequently reported.  A large number of patients with meningiomas are asymptomatic.\n\nOrigins, Growth, and Histology\nThe majority of meningiomas are histologically benign tumors, arising from the cap cells of the arachnoid layer. In many cases, serial imaging studies have revealed a cessation of growth after the time of initial tumor detection. These tumors project inward from the dura, and can cause clinically significant effects due to compression of surrounding neurological structures.  A variety of classification systems based on cytology and histopathology are used with meningiomas.  While the overwhelming majority of meningiomas are histologically benign, the malignant type may result in rapid, widespread infiltration with small (microscopic) \"finger\" projections into adjacent cortex.  In patients with malignant meningiomas, marked deficits in physical and mental status may culminate in death.\n\nRadiological Findings\nPlain films may reveal hyperostosis, erosion, or calcification adjacent to tumor site.  Noncontrast CT's of meningiomas often reveal sharply demarcated, rounded, homogenous masses with slightly increased density when compared to surrounding cortex.  Up to 10% of meningiomas may appear isodense with respect to surrounding brain.  CT may reveal focal cerebral atrophy, edema, or widening of subarachnoid spaces, direct effects of tumor compression of surrounding structures.  Contrast enhanced CT most often reveals homogenous enhancement in approximately 85% of cases.\n\nOn MRI, T1 images are often hypo- or isointense; T2 images often reveal isointense or slightly hyperintense masses. Gadolinium increases signal intensity of meningiomas. A  \"dural tail\" consisting of tissue tapering into the dura may be appreciated.  Imaging studies may reveal extension of mass into cortical structures, or invasion of the calvarium. Angiography often reveals a homogenous, hypervascular pattern.\n\n\nTreatment Options\nA variety of clinical and experimental treatment options exist, including surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.  Resection is the most widely utilized treatment option, although advanced age, concern about loss of neurological function due to surgery, advanced age, and being a poor surgical candidate preclude some from surgical options. Tumor embolization may be employed 3-5 days prior to surgery in an attempt to decrease blood supply to the meningioma. Recurrence of tumor is a possibility after resection. Complete removal of initial tumor and all affected bone results in recurrence rates of less than 10%.\n\nRadiotherapy is often employed during the presurgical period.  Likewise radiotherapy after incomplete resection of a meningioma may be of considerable benefit to patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery with a \"gamma knife\" has shown decrease in tumor size in approximately 50% of cases.  Since this technology is relatively new, long term outcome of gamma knife therapy is not known. Brachytherapy with iodine-125 has been described in the literature; long term outcomes have yet to be determined. Medical treatment options include recommendations of anticonvulsant prophylaxis in patients with supratentorial masses; corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling may also be warranted.  The use of traditional antineoplastic agents in treating meningiomas has not been met with great success.  Hormonal manipulation may have a beneficial effect on stopping tumor growth; research this area continues.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1596_synpic20748"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1596_synpic20748", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1596_synpic20748.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Large left parietal mass", "age": "26", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "0.0", "figure_part": "1a"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n26 y.o. man complains of headache\n\nPhysical Exam:\nNo abnormal findings\n\nImaging Findings:\n6 cm extra axial left parietal mass with vasogenic edema", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

This disease is endemic to 74 countries to include Central and South America, Egypt and other African nations, the Middle East, Asia (particularly rural areas in China), and India.  The infection is brought to the United States by immigrants and travelers returning from endemic areas.  \n\nThe main species of blood flukes or Schistosomes to infect humans are S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi, and S. haematobium.  The first three species characteristically affect the gastrointestinal tract (inhabiting the portal veins) and the latter typically affects the urinary tract (inhabit veins of bladder) and is the most common cause of bladder calcification in the world.  The incidence in males is nine times greater than in females.  Risk factors include but are not limited to extreme poverty, lack of public health facilities, and poor sanitary conditions.  Infection most commonly occurs in adults who live in rural areas and/or who work in either the agricultural or freshwater fishing fields.\n\nRoute of Infection: Schistosomiasis is a chronic infection caused by parasitic trematode worms that currently affects 200 million people in subtropical and tropical environments and is not an insignificant threat to deployed military members. Schistosomiasis infection in humans begins with cercariae penetration of the skin or buccal mucosal from a contaminated water source.  Schistosome ova are subsequently deposited within the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract and a granulomatous and fibrotic reaction ensues, resulting in a multisystemic and often nonspecific clinical manifestations.  Schistosomiasis is major cause of portal hypertension worldwide and can potentially result in permanent gastrointestinal and urinary system damage if not appropriately treated. \n\nClinical:  Clinical manifestations can be separated into three different phases: acute, chronic, and severe.  Also known as Katayama fever, the acute phase is usually found in children or young adults who have not had any prior exposure to Schistosomes.  Believed to be the result of high antigen exposure, this early phase is more commonly associated with S. japonicum infections.  Clinical manifestations of this early phase include: dermatitis, bronchospasm, fever, malaise, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia; amongst other nonspecific complaints.  The chronic phase, which is usually subclinical, is characterized clinically by diarrhea and fevers.  There may be related growth rate depression, hepato- and/or splenomegaly, and complications of hepatic fibrosis (i.e. portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, varices of the esophagus and related hemetemesis).  \n\nThe most frequent cause of death in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is gastrointestinal bleeding.  Bladder fibrosis may contribute to ureteral obstruction, pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis which can lead to renal failure.  Bladder infection has been linked with the development of bladder carcinoma.  The severe phase of disease, unlike the chronic phase, is typically symptomatic.   \n\nThe Schistosome has a complex life cycle: humans are infected through contact with contaminated fresh water.  The pathophysiology of gastrointestinal calcification is related to the Schistosome fluke eggs deposited in tissues and not caused by the flukes themselves.  Following deposition of these Schistoma fluke eggs within the venules of the urinary tract (most commonly the bladder and distal ureters), and gastrointestinal tract lumen, there is development of a hypersensitivity or granulomatous reaction and fibrosis around the Schistosome eggs.  The severity or degree of calcification correlates with the number of eggs deposited.  Many of the eggs are swept back into the liver, where they become lodged within the parenchyma and result in hepatic calcification, fibrosis and associated portal hypertension.   \n\nClinical manifestations can be separated into three different phases: acute, chronic, and severe.  Also known as Katayama fever, the acute phase is usually found in children or young adults who have not had any prior exposure to Schistosomes.  Believed to be the result of high antigen exposure, this early phase is more commonly associated with S. japonicum infections.  Clinical manifestations of this early phase include: dermatitis, bronchospasm, fever, malaise, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia; amongst other nonspecific complaints.  The chronic phase, which is usually subclinical, is characterized clinically by diarrhea and fevers.  There may be related growth rate depression, hepato- and/or splenomegaly, and complications of hepatic fibrosis (i.e. portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, varices of the esophagus and related hemetemesis).  \n\nThe most frequent cause of death in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is gastrointestinal bleeding.  Bladder fibrosis may contribute to ureteral obstruction, pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis which can lead to renal failure.  Bladder infection has been linked with the development of bladder carcinoma.  The severe phase of disease, unlike the chronic phase, is typically symptomatic.   \n\nThe diagnosis can be readily made through the identification of eggs in stool in S. japonicum and S. mansoni infection or by detecting eggs in urine in S. haematobium infection.   Other more aggressive means of definitive diagnosis include liver, rectal, or bladder biopsy.  Additonal nonaggressive yet relatively sensitive diagnostic tests include oval precipitaiton testing and an intradermal immunological skin test for the Schistosome antigen.  \n\nImaging can play a role in demonstrating the extent of organ involvement and complications of Schistosomiasis infection.  Conventional radiography may be the initial means of detecting calcification of the bladder or distal ureters (parallel linear radiodense appearance).  Intravenous pyleogram (IVP) or cystography in particular are very good studies for demonstrating ureteritis cystica, ureteral stricture (or dilation), hydronephrosis, mucosal irregularity, urolithiasis, decreased bladder capacity, bladder tumor, and inflammatory pseudoployps.  CT is useful and more sensitive than radiography for the detection and characterization of urolithiasis and pyelonephritis.  \n\nNodular hepatic lesions have been demonstrated sonographically and by CT in acute Schistosomiasis.  In the colon, extensive curvilinear or tram-track calcifications have been identified in patients with schistosomiasis japonica. Another study involving intravenous contrast-enhanced CT in Schistosomiasis japonica hepatic infection, showed septal, amorphous, and capsular contrast enhancement patterns.  This study concluded that septal enhancement may suggest the diagnosis of hepatic schistosomiasis japonica, particularly when calcification is not identified on noncontrast CT study.  The most reliable diagnostic techniques for detecting chronic bladder disease are cystoscopy, serology, CT and to a lesser extent urography.  Urinalysis in chronic disease may result in missed detection of disease that would otherwise be identified during the early phase of disease.  \n\nhttp://tmcr.usuhs.mil/tmcr/chapter2/intro.htm", "keywords": "SchistosomiasisJaponicumParasites", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1706_synpic30077", "MPX1706_synpic30080"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1706_synpic30077", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1706_synpic30077.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Axial intravenous contast-enhanced CT image at the level of the lower abdomen", "age": "51", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.1", "figure_part": "2a"}, {"image_id": "MPX1706_synpic30080", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1706_synpic30080.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Axial intravenous contrast-enhanced CT image through the pelvis", "age": "51", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.1", "figure_part": "3a"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nA 51-year-old woman presents with chronic left flank and pelvic pain.

Lynch I has no history of associated cancers.  Lynch II often presents with other cancers most commonly of ovarian or uterine origin. Both types are predisposed to a higher frequency of proximal colonic tumors with advanced pathology compared to typical colon cancer. \n\nHNPCC typically presents during the fourth and fifth decades and characterized by adenomas that progress much more rapidly to carcinoma than typical.  These are not as numerous as those in Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).  It also has a more heterogenous genetic basis than FAP, with most cases linked to chromosomes 2,3, and 7.

This system uses radiologic findings from CT or ultrasound to classify renal \"cysts\" into four categories.\nIsrael & Bosniak - http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/236/2/441\nTable of Classes - http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content-nw/full/236/2/441/T1\n•  Class 1:\n» Homogeneous water attenuation\n» No internal architecture\n» No enhancement\nThe first category includes only simple cysts that are homogeneous, have well defined margins, are -10 to +20 Hounsfield units in density (like that of water), do not contain septa, calcifications, nor solid components; and, they do not enhance with contrast.  This is the most common category, occurring in at least 50% of the population over 50 years of age.  This is also the most benign category and requires little if any follow-up.\n\n•  Class 2:\nThe second category includes simple cysts that may have additional radiologic findings.  Findings that will increase the classification from Class 1 to Class 2 include:\n»  the presence of thin hyaline septa\n»  mild calcification in the cyst wall or in the thin septa\n»  uniform hyperdensity\n\nThese have < 5% chance of malignancy and often are not provided follow up.\n\nThere has been much controversy in the literature about inter-observer variability when it comes to the distinguishing between class 2 and class 3 cysts.  This forced the classification system to give rise to a new category so as to more accurately describe the range between Class 2 and Class 3 cysts. \n \n•  Class 2F (meaning \"needs follow-up\"): \n»  multiple thin septa that may have mild or moderate nodular calcification\n»  mild thickening of the wall or septa\n»  minimal \"perceived enhancement\" of cyst wall or septa\n»  non-enhancing hyperdense intrarenal cysts > 3cm\n\nClass 2F cysts may require 6 month follow-up exams over 24 months.\n\nAll Class 2 and 2F cysts may NOT have \"measurable enhancement\" with contrast and should be generally well marginated.\n\n•  Class 3:\nThe third category includes complex cysts that have irregular, thickened walls and/or septa.  These cysts may have extensive calcification and will enhance with contrast.  However, these cysts should be relatively homogeneous in density and should not contain solid components.\n\nThese masses need surgical intervention in most cases, because they may be:\n» MLCN - Multiloculated Cystic Nephroma\n» Hemorrhagic cysts\n» Infected cysts\n\n•  Class 4:\nThe fourth and last Bosniak category can include all of the previously stated components - but show definite enhancing soft-tissue regions, appear heterogeneous in density, and have various solid or hypercalcified inclusions - indicating possible necrosis.  In previous studies, this class has always been shown to indicate cancer on follow-up pathological report - and they should be removed. \n \nMany small retrospective studies have shown the Bosniak classification system to be quite useful in making a clinical decision between choosing surgical therapy versus clinical follow-up with serial CT scans. \n\nIts only criticism comes from individuals who feel that the radiologic inter-observer variability is too large and is a major diagnostic concern.\n\neMedicine - http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3189.htm\n\nCTISUS - http://www.ctisus.org/cta_web/8_05/Fielding/AR_08-05_CTA_Fielding.htm\n\nRadiology - http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/abstract/231/2/365\n\nAJR - http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/181/5/1425", "keywords": "Bosniakcyst classificationrenal cell carcinoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2281_synpic37388", "MPX2281_synpic37390", "MPX2281_synpic37555"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2281_synpic37388", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2281_synpic37388.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Right renal complex cyst", "age": "61", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "0.0", "figure_part": "5b"}, {"image_id": "MPX2281_synpic37390", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2281_synpic37390.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Right renal complex cyst", "age": "61", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "0.0", "figure_part": "6b"}, {"image_id": "MPX2281_synpic37555", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2281_synpic37555.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Right renal complex cyst", "age": "61", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "8.3", "figure_part": "7"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n61 year old woman complains of non-specific abdominal pain.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nPatient had non-specific abdominal pain for the last 3 months.

The symptoms worsen with exertion.  Cranial muscles are affected in 85% cases (lids, extraocular muscles, facial weakness, nasal or slurred speech, dysphagia).  These may be the only muscles affected, especially in the elderly.  As the disease becomes generalized, the limb muscles (often proximal and asymmetric) become involved.  Reflexes and sensation should be normal.  Primary complications are aspiration pneumonia (weak bulbar muscles) and respiratory failure (weak chest wall muscles).Pathophysiology:Specific anti-AchR antibodies reduce the number of AchRs at the NMJ.  With repeated muscle contraction, there is a decrease in the amount of acetylcholine released per impulse.  This results in pathologic fatigue.  The thymus is abnormal in 75% of patients with myasthenia (65% hyperplasia and 10% thymomas).  The reason for this compelling association remains unknown, but it is theorized that because the thymus contains a small number of myoid cells (which are distinguished by muscle striations and AcH receptors on their surface) along with the B-cells and T-cells, the thymus may play a role in myasthenia gravis by acting as an antigenic peptide sequence on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Evaluation:\nOther autoimmune disorders may also be associated with myasthenia gravis (thyroiditis, Graves’ Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and pure red cell aplasia) and should be evaluated for in the newly diagnosed patient with myasthenia.\n\nEvaluation:\n1.\tAchR antibodies – positive antibodies are diagnostic but not correlated with disease severity\n2.\tTensilon (edrophonium) test – short-acting anticholinesterase\n3.\tEMG – low frequency (2-4Hz) repetitive stimulation produces decreased amplitude\n4.\tChest CT/MRI – search for thymic abnormalities\n5.\tOther associated autoimmune disorders\n\nMedical Management:\n1.\tOcular only – pyridostigmine\n2.\tGeneralized – pyridostigmine, and immunosuppression (while steroids are the mainstay of treatment, the addition of cyclosporin may allow a decrease in the steroid dose)\n3.\tCrisis – Intensive care (intubate, fluids), plasmapheresis or IVIg\n\nSurgical Management:\n1.\tEvaluate for thymectomy (improves the likelihood of long-term remission in the adult).\n\nThe efficacy and use of thymectomy in the absence of thymoma is still controversial.  A review of literature shows that thymectomy was associated with disease remission and improvement with a rate of medication free remission of 2.1 and an improvement rate of 1.7.  However, there are other studies that reveal no statistical difference between thymectomy in the absence of thymoma and medical management only.  Still, for several reasons most neurologists and CT surgeons still recommend that total thymectomy be done.  First, you cannot tell the difference between thymic hyperplasia and thymic atrophy on imaging studies.

However, the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) autoantibodies are still circulating and affect other cell types with TSHR antigens such as fibroblasts, adipocytes, and T-cells contributing to tissue proliferation, inflammation and edema consistent with Grave's ophthalmopathy and pretibial myxedema.", "topic_title": "Grave's Ophthalmopathy", "acr_code": "1.2", "category": "Ophthalmology", "disease_discussion": "Grave’s ophthalmopathy (orbitopathy).  Although rare, it can occur in 2% patients with a history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.  Grave’s and Hashimoto’s diseases are on opposite sides of the thyroid disease spectrum — manifesting hyperthyroid and hypothyroid symptoms, respectively.  Both diseases can occur in the same person with variable temporal manifestations.  However, the majority of ophthalmopathy cases correlate with Grave’s disease.\n\nApproximately 10% of patients who have ophthalmopathy do not have clinical thyroid disease and are considered euthyroid, but do have elevated serum thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid-specific T-cells circulating.  Within the remaining 90% who do have clinical thyroid disease, approximately 40% have ophthalmic presentation within 6 months after diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, 20% have concurrent clinical thyroid and ophthalmic disease presentation, and 20% have ophthalmic involvement prior to diagnosis of thyroid disease.  Grave’s orbitopathy affects about 16 women and 3 men in a population of 100,000 per year with men having greater severity of disease.    \n\nRisk factors for development of Grave's ophthalmopathy are female, positive family history autoimmune diseases, smoking, age, and radioiodine therapy for Grave's hyperthyroidism (compared to surgery or antithyroid drugs). \n\nGrave’s orbitopathy results in bilateral proptosis, lid retraction, chemosis, and vision changes in affected persons attributing to the increase in retroorbital connective tissue and extraocular muscle enlargement.  Complications may involve corneal ulceration and infection due to loss of eye protection and lubrication.\n\nThe pathogenesis involves autoantibodies against thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antigens that can be found in the thyroid as well as in other tissues.  It is unknown why retroorbital tissues are predominantly affected.  Studies show that retroorbital fibroblasts and adipocytes express TSHR mRNA suggesting the mechanism of TSHR antibodies directly stimulating the fibroblasts and adipocytes resulting in increased production of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and fat tissue.\n\nAnother mechanism in the pathogenesis of Grave's ophthalmopathy involves T-cells that recognize self TSHR antigens as foreign.  This autoimmune process stimulates T-cells to produce cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interferon gamma that recruit lymphocytes and create inflammation and edema within the orbit.  Hence, there is lymphocytic infiltration of extraocular muscles and associated edema accounting for muscle belly enlargement.  It is not known why the inferior recti are usually affected first, followed by the medial recti, then superior recti, and lastly the lateral recti, but this is a consistent finding.\n\nTreatment for Grave's ophthalmopathy depends on severity of symptoms.

Approximately 40% of cases of medullary nephrocalcicosis are attributable to primary hyperparathyroidism, another 20% to renal tubular acidosis, and the remaining 40% divided among many other causes.  Most of the conditions that cause nephrocalcinosis can also result in nephrolithiasis.  Their coexistence helps establish the etiology and may significantly impact patient management.  The appearance of medullary nephrocalcinosis equates to calcifications involving the distal convoluted tubules in the loops of Henle.\n    \nHYPERCALCIURIA, in general, is due to to dissolution of the bone, excessive ingestion or absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract, or faulty renal reabsorption of calcium.  Hyperparathyroidism is the most common single cause.  Medullary nephrocalcicosis is seen in 5% of those with primary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid adenoma), and nephrolithiasis is seen in 50-80% of these patients.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism (usually due to renal disease) is a much less likely cause.\n\nRENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS is characterized by abnormal renal tubular function that results in chronic systemic acidosis and a persistent alkali urine.  There are two types of RTA.  Type II RTA consists of proximal abnormalities, in which there is a greater than normal loss of bicarbonate, and renal calculi are not formed.  Distal tubular dysfunction (type I RTA) interferes with hydrogen ion transfer into the urine, and may result in stone formation. 30% of infants and 70% of adults with type I RTA develop medullary nephrocalcicosis or nephrolithiasis.  RTA may cause delayed skeletal maturation and osteomalacia.  Primary RTA results from an inherited enzymatic defect.  Diseases known to cause secondary RTA include Wilson’s disease, Fanconi’s syndrome, hyperglobinemias, nephrotoxic drugs (outdated tetracycline, amphotericine B), and acetazolamide administration.  These processes (primary or secondary causes of RTA) result in an inability to acidify urine.  Since calcium ions are much more soluble in acidic urine crystalline calcium salts precipitate.\n\nRENAL TUBULAR ECTASIA, or medullary sponge kidney, is a disease in which the terminal nephrons and ducts of Bellini are dilated.  Calculi form in about half the cases owing to stasis of urine in these dilated ducts.

Thirty percent contain calcifications.  They vary from an almost entirely cystic mass to a predominately solid mass with internal cystic components.\n\nBenign (mature) cystic teratomas, often incorrectly termed \"dermoid cysts\", are usually found in female patients 10-30 years old - very common in the reproductive years.  Teratoma is the most common ovarian tumor in children, adolescents, and young women (<30 years) with the majority presenting in adolescents.  Fifteen to 25% of cases are bilateral.  Most authors differentiate Dermoid cysts from Dermoids which are predominately cystic, but the presence of heterogeneous and varied tissue elements give them a complex and varied imaging appearance. \n\nTrue dermoids - unlike mature cystic teratomas - originate from ectoderm only and may contain hair, teeth, and sebaceous glands, whereas teratomas originate from multipotential germ cells that may and may contain any tissue element: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm .\n\nTeratomas may also be found in the mediastinum, intracranially, or anywhere rests of multipotential germ cells were left during embryogenesis.  In fact, teratomas are the most common congenital intracranial tumor.  Additionally, teratomas are the most common benign mediastinal germ cell neoplasm and may be cystic or solid.  The cystic teratomas are usually more mature and more common than the solid type which is usually malignant.  \n\nBenign teratomas have a slight female predominance; and, malignant teratomas are seen almost exclusively in men.  Malignant abdominopelvic teratomas may be accompanied by ascites, intraperitoneal spread, and metastasis to the liver.  \n\nMalignant degeneration of a mature cystic teratoma is rare - but may occurs in 1-2% of cases.  \n\nCommon complications of ovarian teratomas include torsion (ovarian) and hemorrhage.\n\nThe initial imaging modality is usually a sonographic study, as many patients present with abdominal pain.  The mixture of sebum and hair within a mature teratoma is highly echogenic with acoustic shadowing that may totally obscure the back wall of a large mass, a finding known as the “tip of the iceberg” sign.   However, calcification may not be easily detected on ultrasound and plain radiographs may be diagnostic of benign cystic teratomas by demonstrating well formed teeth or bone.  A recognizable tooth within the mass is an almost pathognomonic finding.  Plain film may also reveal a subtle well-defined mass of fat density.  \n\nCT scan confirms the cystic, fatty, and calcified components and demonstrates a well circumscribed cystic mass lesion with fluid, fat, and calcification.  \n\nCharacterization by MRI depends on demonstration of fat by chemical shift artifact or fat suppression imaging.  Fat or sebaceous material within the cyst follows the signal of subcutaneous fat on all imaging sequences.  Fat-fluid levels, layering of debris, dermoid plugs (mural nodules), and calcifications are additional findings.  A small percentage of cystic teratomas contain simple fluid showing low signal on T1WI and high signal on T2WI which may be diagnosed as teratomas by demonstration of small deposits of fat in the walls.", "keywords": "dermoid cystcystic teratomagerm cell tumor", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2524_synpic17734", "MPX2524_synpic17736", "MPX2524_synpic17737"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2524_synpic17734", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2524_synpic17734.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with sagital and coronal reconstructions.

Although the typical clinical presentation is a young adult with a painless rapidly growing extremity mass (80-95%of patients), there is a wide age variation with most common age group being the 15-35 year age group. Besides the extremities, primary synovial sarcomas have been described throughout the body to include the heart, brain, and abdomen.\n\nSarcomas are classified according to the tissue they most closely resemble, as such, synovial sarcoma is classically described as a having a biphasic fibrous spindle cell population admixed with an epitheliod component. They likely originate from genetic mutations in totipotent mesenchymal cells, which may explain variations in histologic and anatomic presentation as well as the clinical course of the neoplasm. The translocation t(X:18) is present in greater than 90% of synovial sarcomas.\n\nRadiographs of these patients may be nomral in one-half of patients. Thirty percent of masses shows calcification or less commonly ossification.  In 11-20% of patients, bony erosion of the adjacent bone can be seen.  Both CT and MRI can show areas of necrotic or hemoorhage that appear as aresa of low attenuation on CT images and high attenuation on T2-weighted MR images. Both modalities can demonstrate a multilobulated lesion with septation. Fluid-fluid levels may be seen in areas of hemorrhage. For staging of tumors, MRI is the best modality.  The histologic and chromosomal findings described above are often the key to diagnosis.\n\nTreatment for all synovial sarcomas is resection. According to a retrospective study performed by Ferrari et al, primary synovial sarcoma with clear margins and no evidence of metastases carries a 5-year overall survival of greater than 70%(1).

Ivory vertebrae can represent osteoblastic metastatic disease, commonly stemming from breast cancer (as in this case), or carcinoma of the prostate.  This finding can also be associated with Paget disease, lymphoma, and less commonly with osteosarcoma and carcinoid.  This finding is much less common in children and usually related to Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  \n\nIvory vertebra appears as a  uniformly white vertebra with no abnormality of its contour or adjacent disks. The vertebra stands out against the adjacent normal, or darker, vertebral bodies. \n\nOsteoblastic metastases and lymphoma both result in the replacement of the vertebral body spongiosa with dense, confluent bony mass.  This produces a homogenous sclerotic appearance.  Paget disease often causes expansion of the vertebral body, disrupting the external contours.  \n\nReferences:\n\nGraham TS. The Ivory Vertebra Sign.

However, the differential diagnosis for this finding includes lymphoma or treated lytic mets, and rarely, chordoma, plasmacytoma, or Paget disease. This appearance should be differentiated from the corduroy vertebral body (accentuated vertical striations) of an hemangioma, The rugger jersey vertebral body (radiodense stripes at the top and bottom of the vertebra) of renal osteodystrophy, the picture frame vertebral body (condensation of bone along the margins of the vertebral body) of Paget disease, and the sandwich vertebral body (extreme and uniform increase in radiodensity along the inferior and superior margins of the vertebral body) of osteopetrosis.\n\nPedicle involvement is one clue to the cause of a sclerotic vertebral body.  Destruction of one or both pedicles is a well known result of metastatic disease that is rarely present in the case of plasmacytoma.  Keep in mind, though, that this finding is typically a result of extension of the tumor deposit into the pedicle from the posterior vertebral body, rather than primary deposition into the pedicle.  \n\nPreservation of disc space and vertebral body size are another important indicator of the nature of a sclerotic vertebral body.  Indolent infection such as TB commonly produces end plate destruction, disc space narrowing, and paraspinal soft tissue mass.\n\nPaget disease of  the vertebral body may be difficult to separate from neoplastic causes because it usually involves a single vertebral body.

Because the clinical diagnosis of internal hernia is difficult, imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) and small bowel follow through play an important role. Transmesenteric hernia is the most common type and is usually related to prior abdominal surgery, especially with creation of a Roux-en-Y anastomosis (eg, liver transplantation, gastric bypass). CT may allow confident diagnosis in most cases.\n\nWhen the small bowel herniates through a defect in the mesentery or omentum, the herniated bowel is compressed against the abdominal wall, with no overlying omental fat in most cases and at most levels of anatomic section through the herniated bowel. The herniated bowel tends to appear clustered and lies outside the colon, a reversal of the normal anatomic arrangement. As a result, the adjacent colon is displaced centrally (eg, transverse colon displaced dorsally, ascending colon displaced medially). There will be some degree of compression, crowding, displacement, and obstruction of both the bowel and blood vessels.\n\nThe herniated bowel may also twist within the hernia sac, which results in volvulus and a predisposition to bowel ischemia. Twisting of the mesenteric vessels, or the whirl sign, or twisting of the bowel itself is diagnostic of volvulus, and engorged blood vessels, mesenteric ascites, and bowel wall thickening suggest bowel ischemia.\n\nCT signs most suggestive of transmesenteric hernia are those that depict the abnormal cluster of bowel loops along the periphery of the peritoneal cavity and lack of omental fat covering the clustered small bowel.", "keywords": "transmesenteric herniasmall bowel volvulusintestinal ischemia", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2481_synpic23898", "MPX2481_synpic23899", "MPX2481_synpic23904", "MPX2481_synpic23927"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2481_synpic23898", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2481_synpic23898.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Normal SMV/SMA anatomical relationship (SMV to the right of SMA) excluding midgut congenital malrotation as etiology for SB volvulus.", "age": "27", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.9", "figure_part": "a"}, {"image_id": "MPX2481_synpic23899", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2481_synpic23899.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Level just below SMA takeoff", "age": "27", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.9", "figure_part": "b"}, {"image_id": "MPX2481_synpic23904", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2481_synpic23904.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Occlusion of SMA", "age": "27", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.9", "figure_part": "d"}, {"image_id": "MPX2481_synpic23927", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2481_synpic23927.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Internal hernia", "age": "27", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.9", "figure_part": "g"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n27 y/o woman with sudden onset of periumbilical abdominal pain relieved only by \"bending forward\".

This test is a nuclear medicine study that compares images of inhaled radionuclide material to pulmonary perfusion images of intravenously injected radiolabeled protein.  These images must be closely compared to a chest X-ray taken at or near the time of the V/Q scan.  This is done to ensure defects on the V/Q images are not accounted for by findings on the chest X-ray.  A high probability scan, defined as two or more moderate or large segmental mismatched perfusion defects, in the presence of high clinical suspicion was found to be accurate 96% of the time in the PIOPED study.  The same study also found that a low probability scan in the presence of low clinical suspicion was only falsely negative in 6% of the patients.  However, this leaves a large number of cases in which there is either a moderate clinical suspicion, an intermediate scan, or a discrepancy between pre-test clinical suspicion and final test results.  Therefore, more invasive tests such as pulmonary angiography must often be used for a definitive diagnosis.  \n\nThe chest X-ray is also an important tool in the evaluation a patient with a suspected PE.  In addition to being used in the interpretation of the V/Q scan as mentioned above, chest x-rays are often useful in determining that the cause of the patient's signs and symptoms is due to a condition other than PE.

In patients with either a known malignancy or no known malignancy, benign adrenal masses are more common than adrenal gland metastases.  It is important to be able to differentiate between a benign and malignant adrenal mass as the distinction ultimately affects treatment decisions and overall prognosis for oncology patients.  \n\nBenign adrenal adenomas contain increased intracytoplasmic lipid content resulting in low attenuating lesions (less than 10 HU) on noncontrast CT scans.  Typically, adrenal adenomas are smaller than 4 cm, appearing as smoothly marginated, homogeneous, round masses.  In contrast, metastatic lesions to the adrenal gland are large, heterogeneous, lobulated masses with poorly defined margins, and contain very little intracellular fat.\n\nAn attenuation value of less than 10 HU on noncontrast CT scans is diagnostic of an adrenal adenoma.  However it is important to note that an attenuation value greater than 10 HU is not necessarily diagnostic of a metastatic lesion.  Approximately 30% of benign adenomas will yield attenuation values greater than 10 HU.  Thus, contrast enhanced CT can be employed to further characterize a adrenal lesion.\n\nAfter the administration of intravenous contrast material, benign adrenal adenomas avidly enhance, and the washout of contrast material is more rapid than with metastases.  Comparing noncontrast scans, with immediate postcontrast scans, and following with delayed postcontrast scans (15 minutes after contrast administration) the percentage enhancement washout of a adrenal lesion can be calculated, and determined as benign or malignant.  \n\nPercentage enhancement washout is calculated as the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the delayed enhancement attenuation divided by the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the nonenhanced attenuation multiplied by 100%.  If the percentage enhancement washout is greater than 60%, then the adrenal lesion can be characterized as a benign adrenal adenoma.  Additionally, if the nonenhanced attenuation is unavailable, the relative percentage enhancement washout can be calculated similarly as the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the delayed enhancement attenuation divided by the immediate enhancement attenuation multiplied by 100%.  If the relative percentage enhancement washout is greater than 50%, then the adrenal lesion can be classified as a benign adrenal adenoma.  Values of less than either 60% or 50% for the appropriate calculation are indicative of either a metastases or an atypical adenoma.\n\nIf an adrenal lesion cannot be adequately characterized on contrast enhanced CT, chemical shift MR imaging can be used exploiting the knowledge that adrenal adenomas contain intracellular lipid.  Chemical shift MR is the difference in behavior of lipid and water protons in a magnetic field.  Within an imaged voxel, gradient echo image sequences are performed to separate fat and water protons.  Using the spleen as an internal standard, demonstrating loss of signal within an adrenal mass on the T1-weighted out-of-phase image when compared to a corresponding T1-weighted in-phase image, confirms the presence of intracellular lipid, which characterizes a benign adrenal adenoma.  A metastatic lesion will not demonstrate a loss of signal intensity on the T1-weighted out-of-phase image, secondary to its poor intracytoplasmic lipid composition.\n\nOf note, chemical shift imaging and nonenhanced CT are not complimentary, since both modalities will most likely characterize the same subset of lipid-rich adenomas.\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nFollowing the change in a lesion’s size is a useful indicator in predicting malignancy.

Sixty-five percent of melanomas occur in those older than 50 years.  Patients may be asymptomatic with lesions discovered during a routine ophthalmologic examination.  Other patients may notice vision loss, photopsia, and visual field deficits.  \n\nMelanomas primarily metastasize to the liver, as well as to the lung, bone, kidney, and brain.  Treatment is dependent on site of origin, size, location of the primary lesion, and on the presence of extraocular extension, recurrence, or metastases.  Melanomas greater than 1 cm in thickness are managed with enucleation.  Medium sized lesions (3 mm to 1 cm) may be managed with enucleation, plaque brachytherapy and external-beam radiation.  Small tumors (<3 mm in thickness) are monitored every 3-6 months with US.  \n\nUveal melanomas are usually assessed by ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein angiography, US, CT or MR imaging.

Up to 50% report viral illness or vaccination that occurred days to weeks prior to onset of symptoms.\n\nParsonage Turner syndrome presents as the acute onset of severe shoulder pain followed shortly thereafter by weakness of at least one shoulder muscle.  Bilateral involvement has been reported for as many as one third of patients.  It can be confused clinically with cervical spondylosis, rotator cuff tear, shoulder impingement syndrome, and acute calcific tendonitis.  Failure to identify PTS may result in inappropriate treatment or potnentially unnecessary surgery.\n\nPTS may involve single or multiple nerves originating from the brachial plexus.  The suprascapular is the most commonly affected (97% of cases), followed by the axillary (50% of cases) and far less commonly the subscapular and long thoracic.  In cases involving the suprascapular nerve, the supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles are affected.  Inflammation of the subscapular nerve affects the subscapularis muscle.  The serratous anterior muscle is affected when the long thoracic nerve is involved, and the teres minor and deltoid muscles are affected in cases involving an axillary nerve distribution.\n\nThe MR finding most typical of PTS is that of diffuse high T2 signal involving one or more muscles innervated by the brachial plexus.  T1-weighted images may also show atrophy of the affected muscle(s). The pattern of muscular involvement should match the distribution(s) of one or more peripheral nerves originating from the brachial plexus\n\nNo test can be used to diagnose PTS specifically. Both electromyograms and MR images must be interpreted with consideration of the clinical history.  The disorder is self-limited, but can take up to a year to resolve.  Residual denervation can be seen in 10-20% of cases after 2 years.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nGaskins CM, Helms CA.  Parsonage-Turner syndrome: MR imaging findings and clinical information of 27 patients.

Its etiology is unknown; however, the most widely accepted theory is that it is a developmental abnormality of mesenchyme in which osteoblasts fail to undergo normal morphologic differentiation and maturation.  The medullary cavity is filled with fibrous tissue in which trabeculae of poorly calcified primitive new bone are developed by osseous metaplasia.  Both sexes are equally affected.  It begins early in life, often in infancy, but being frequently asymptomatic it usually remains unrecognized until adulthood.\n\nFibrous dysplasia is not hereditary, and it may involve one or many bones.  The polyostotic variety and rarely the monostotic type when associated with endocrine dysfunction, typically manifested by precocious female sexual development and cutaneous pigmentation, is known as the McCune-Albright syndrome.\n\nFibrous dysplasia may be associated with either solitary or multiple lesions, in one or more bones.  Approximately 70-80% of cases are monostotic, 20-30% are polyostotic, and 2-3% are associated with endocrinopathies.  Abnormal cutaneous pigmentation, which is the most common extraskeletal manifestation of fibrous dysplasia, is evident in more than half of patients with polyostotic disease and is almost always present in those with both multiple bone lesions and endocrine dysfunction.  However, it is quite infrequently seen with monostotic lesions.  Monostotic fibrous dysplasia is most frequently encountered in a rib, femur, tibia, calvarium and humerus in order of decreasing frequency, however, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia more frequently involves the skull and facial bones, pelvis, spine and shoulder girdle.\n\nInvolvement of the skull and the facial bones is noted in approximately 10-25% of patients with monostotic fibrous dysplasia and in 50% of those with polyostotic involvement.  Common areas of involvement in the skull include the frontal, sphenoid, maxillary and ethmoid bones; the occipital and temporal bones are affected less commonly.\n\nRoutine radiographs commonly reveal single or multiple, symmetric or asymmetric radiolucent or sclerotic lesions in the skull and facial bones or both.  Profound and often extensive sclerosis tends to predominate in the skull and particularly affects its base and the sphenoid wings.\n\nHazy radiolucent lesions which are usually the most common manifestation of fibrous dysplasia are often associated with widened diploic spaces and expansion in the skull and facial bones.  The osseous expansion is focal or widespread and is almost always in an outward direction.  The outer table of the vault is invariably convex, whereas both tables remain essentially intact rather than destroyed as is the case frequently with Paget's disease.  Another manifestation in the cranial vault represents variable sized, localized, relatively radiolucent zones which when surrounded by a sclerotic rim may have a doughnut shape.

These tears most commonly occur at the tendinous insertion of the quadriceps to superior pole of the patella.  \n\nPatients usually present with knee pain, swelling and difficulty ambulating.  Physical exam with complete tears classically demonstrates suprapatellar swelling, a palpable defect in the suprapatellar region with tenderness, a low-riding patella, and decreased active range of motion and strength of knee extension.  Partial tears are often much more difficult to discern clinically and as such may be easily misdiagnosed as a \"knee sprain.\"\n\nImaging modalites such as plain radiography and MRI are often used to support the clinical findings.  Findings that suggest quadriceps tear on plain radiographs include suprapatellar soft tissue swelling and distortion of the typical fat planes, and patella baja (inferiorly positioned patella).  Due to the fact the injury commonly occurs at the tendinous insertion site at the patella, avulsion fractures of the patella may also be seen.  MRI demonstrates disruption of the normal low intensity quadriceps tendon on T2 weighted images, which is replaced by high intensity fluid signal secondary to inflammatory response and edema.  Ultrasound is another modality that may be used to demonstrate quadriceps tendon tears.  However, unlike MRI, ultrasound will not demonstrate secondary associated findings often seen in traumatic injuries to the knee such as ligamentous and osteochondral insults, and as such is used much less frequently.\n\nPartial tears are treated conservatively, typically with a 1-2 month peroid of immobilization in full knee extesion, followed by a course of physical therapy to restore range of motion and strength.  Complete tears are usually treated with early surgical intervention which again is followed by a course of immobilization and physical therapy.", "keywords": "quadricepstearrupture", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1737_synpic52862", "MPX1737_synpic52863", "MPX1737_synpic52864", "MPX1737_synpic52865", "MPX1737_synpic52866", "MPX1737_synpic52867"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52862", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52862.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2a"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52863", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52863.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2b"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52864", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52864.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2c"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52865", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52865.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2d"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52866", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52866.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2e"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52867", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52867.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2f"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n52 y/o male with swollen painful knee and weakness in extension s/p fall\n\nPhysical Exam:\nMarked swelling superior aspect of joint.

Some of the benefits of the arthroscopic approach are less morbidity such as less risk for injury to the axillary and musculocutaneous nerves and subcutaneous tissue, quicker recovery time, improved shoulder stability, and more effective response to physical therapy.  The disadvantages of arthroscopic surgery include higher failure rates (7-17% will redislocate).    The advantages of open surgery include less than 10% failure rate and more accurate repair.

Intraosseous lipomas may be seen in patients of all ages, with a predilection for young to middle age adults.  They are most commonly detected in the metaphysis or epiphysis of the long bones of the lower extremity with 50% involving the femur, tibia, and fibula.  These tumors may also be found in other long bones, the skull and jaws, ribs, pelvis, and frequently (15%) in the calcaneus, which is the most common tarsal bone involved.\n\nThe typical plain film appearance of intraosseous lipomas is a geographic, well marginated, osteolytic lesion with a thin sclerotic rim.  Lobulations at the margins or internal osseous ridges are common as is a central nidus of dystrophic calcification, which is nearly pathognomonic for this tumor.  This central calcification is secondary to fat necrosis.  Osseous expansion may be evident, especially in bones of small caliber.  Computed tomography demonstrates attenuation similar to subcutaneous fat with regions of cystic changes. The differential diagnosis includes simple bone cyst (unicameral), fibrous dysplasia, and when calcified, enchondroma and clear cell chondrosarcoma.  Bone infarct is also a diagnostic consideration.

It has taken some time for vendors to develop the software necessary to accurately and efficiently use existing MR technology for a screening population.  MR utility has been extensively used for problem-solving and for evaluation of the patient with impants. \n\nThe exquisite contrast sensitivity of MR is balanced in the high-risk patient by somewhat decreased specificity; many things other than cancer enhance, but benign entities often have an intrinsic high T2 signal whereas breast cancer does not.\n\nSensitivity has been greatly improved with the use of dynamic contrast-enhancement, and the addition of software tools allowing the creation of a graphical depiction of contrast kinetics within a specified region of interest.  Given that the region is selected appropriately, breast cancer tissue will typically exhibit an early wash-in, and a rapid wash-out of contrast enhancement.  In contradistinction, beningn tissue will demonstrate a progressive increase in enhancement or alternatively a plateau. \n\nSoftware refinements continue to be made in order to hopefully better define the specific region of interest and therefore yield the best curve.\n\nAt the time this case was performed, the combination fo software and hardware technology necessary to perform adequate screening MR had only been available for approximately 2 months.  This patient's cancer was only detectable initially through this modality.  The mammogram was, even retrospectively, negative, and there was no palpable abnormality for which to justify an ultrasound (although the lesion was in fact visible under ultrasound).  This cancer almost certainly would have not been found until it was at a much more advanced state, and this patient's life may have just been saved-- a feat that would have likely not been possible just a few months ago.", "topic_title": "Infiltrating ductal carcinoma", "acr_code": "0.3", "category": "Neoplasm, carcinoma", "disease_discussion": "The majority of invasive breast cancers are nonspecific forms of carcinoma that orginate in the ductal epithelium, likely in the terminal duct at its juncton with the lobule.  The better differentiated forms of invasive ductal carcinoma create specfic patterns that have been subclassified but the majority of ductal malignancies fall into the general category of undifferentiated cancers.  When a cancer does not fit into any of the defined subtypes it is termed not otherwise specified (NOS).  The relative frequency of these lesion appears to remain fairly constant regardless of age.  In general, infiltrating ductal carcinoma NOS elicits a vigorous desmosplastic response with fibrosis. \n\nSometimes, these cancers are found first by the woman herself.  In general, these are firm lesions that may tether to the skin or the chest wall.  Vascular and lymphatic spread result, and if left untreated, carcinoma may eventually erode through the skin, producing an ulcerated mass.  Dermal lymphatic involvement with tumor can occur early in the course early in the course of the disease, signaling the poor prognosis associated with inflammatory carcinoma.  \n\nPathologist have subclassified infiltrating ductal carcinoma into low-grade (I) fairly uniform cell types that show some differentiation (mucin or tubule) to high grade (III) in which anaplastic, pleomorphic cell predominate.  Collagen production is prominent feature of many breast cancers, and calcium deposition is common within the tumor.  These are responsible for the characteristic firm gritty nature of these malignancies.\n\nThe mammographic appearance of breast cancer is varied.  The diagnosis is high suggestive when an irregular mass with spiculated margins is present.  Lobulated shapes are fairly common, and the more undulating the border, the more suspicious the lesion.  Some ductal cancers reveal their presence early by the deposition of calcium which is due to either direct cellular secretion or cell necrosis.  The fibrosis, desmoplasia and cicatrization that accompany many ductal cancers may produce distortion of surrounding architecture with or without an apparent tumor mass, and this may lead to skin/nipple retraction.  Breast cancer usually produces an ill-defined shadow, but even “garden variety” infiltrating ductal carcinoma may produce a sharply circumscribed mass that is indistinguishable from a benign lesion.  The generally greater x-ray attenutation relative to its volume often distinguishes the malignant lesion.\n\nSome cancers infiltrate without distorting the normal breast architecture and without calcium deposition.  If the normal parenchymal abutting the tumor is the same radiographic density, the tumor may be undectable by mammography.  Occasionally, the only indication of the presence of cancer nonspecific asymmetric density.\n\nJust as there is spectrum of mammographic presentations, the ultrasound appearance of breast cancer is extremely variable.  The classic description of breast cancer is an irregularly shaped hypoechoic structure that frequently has a triangular anterior margin and attenuates and scatters sound, producing shadowing.  This appearance is characteristic of a spiculated scirrhous lesion.  Cancers are almost always irregular, frequently lobulated and hypoechoic.  Breast cancers tend to be more vertically oriented relative to the skin surface but there are always exceptions.

Mafee, MD \n\nDISCUSSION:\t\nThe membranous labyrinth or cavity consists of the cochlear aqueduct, the vestibular organ, the endolymphatic duct and sac, the round window membrane, and their associated vasculature.  The bony labyrinth includes the vestibule, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea.  The membranous labyrinth of the inner ear begins to form during the early months of gestation.  By mid-term, the mesenchyme that surrounds the labyrinth has transformed into cartilage, and begins to ossify.  The endolymphatic duct and sac are the only portions that grow after birth, and they continue to enlarge until sometime after puberty.\n\nThere is considerable controversy concerning the origin of these slowly growing, yet highly destructive lesions of the temporal bone.  Several recent reports have emphasized that these tumors probably do arise from the epithelial elements lining the endolymphatic system (especially the sac).  The most common presentation is hearing loss, facial nerve palsy, and vestibular dysfunction. \n\nThere appear to be at least 2 categories of this lesion, a slowly growing, relatively benign adenomatous tumor, and a more aggressive lesion with a capillary configuration.  The papillary lesions probably arise within the posterior aspects of the petrous bone in the retrolabyrinthine region.  The lesions may be hypervascular, supplied by  branches of the external carotid artery, and may contain blood products that produce characteristic regions of hyperintensity on T1WI and hypointensity on T2WI.  Intratumoral calcifications within these lesions may represent \"bone sequestra\" produced when the tumor infiltrates into the petrous bone.  Because these lesions may be surrounded by a thin shell of reactive bone, it has been suggested that at least during some portion of their growth, they may expand relatively slowly.  The lesions almost invariably show contrast enhancement.  Some of the tumors have a speckled pattern of hyperintensity on T1WI, which can mimic the appearance of other vascular lesions of the petrous apex, including glomus tumors.\n\nThe papillary endolymphatic sac tumor has been associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL)and may present with bilateral papillary endolymphatic sac neoplasms.  It is also interesting to remember that patients with VHL may develop cystadenomas in the testis and in relationship to the female pelvic adnexa.  \n\nIn this patient, the differential diagnosis could include chondroid lesions (benign chondroma as well as low-grade chondrosarcoma, and chondromyxoid fibroma), cholesterol granuloma, metastatic disease, and possibly an aggressive epidermoid cyst.\n\nBecause the histology of this lesion may be confusing to surgical pathologists, an accurate preoperative localization by neuroimaging can assist in suggesting the correct diagnosis.  The prognosis can be quite good after careful gross removal of the lesion.  However, incomplete resection is associated with recurrence.\n\nSUGGESTED READINGS:\n\nBatsakis, J.G. and el-Naggar, A.K.

The condition can be manifested shortly after birth, or it can remain asymptomatic for the life of the individual and be found subsequently on postmortem exam.  Due to this large variation in presentation, this defect presents itself along a wide spectrum, making it difficult to diagnose unless imaging of the brain is preformed.  \n\n\tOccurrence of corpus callosal defects is said to occur in roughly 0.7-5.3% of the US population, with a suggested similar worldwide occurrence .  The condition is noted to be hereditary in some cases, being passed down either as an X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant depending on the associated disease.  It has also been known to occur often with one of the many different trisomies, most often to include 8, 13, 18, and 21 .  Conditions which often coincide with this defect include Chiari II malformations, encephalocele, schizencephaly, lissencephaly, and many syndromes such as Aicardi’s, CRASH and fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\t\n\tThe congenital form of callosal agenesis usually occurs due to a defect in embryological development during the 7-20th gestational week .  Normal development of the corpus callosum begins with formation from the commissural plate of the telencephalon .  The genu and the body are formed first, followed in time by the development of the rostrum and splenium. From this, white matter axons develop which form projections into the bilateral cerebral cortices. An embryological defect in any of the stages can cause either complete or partial agenesis of the callosum, if occurring later in development a defect in the posterior section is generally observed.  Finally, if the genu and body are dysgenic, one can assume that a secondary cause is manifesting such as infection or hemorrhage due to the embryologic sequence of formation previously mentioned. \n\n\tPresentation usually occurs secondary to an associated congenital defect, mental retardation, seizures, or as an incidental finding on an MRI.  Diagnosis is best performed by MRI, which demonstrates much finer detail of the lesion and any surrounding neuronal disturbances.  Findings often noted in addition to an agenic/dysgenic corpus callosum include a high riding third ventricle, enlarged occipital horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly), longitudinal straightening of the lateral ventricles, and parallel white matter bands along the midline where the corpus would normally develop termed “Probst bundles.” In addition, the absence of the cingulate gyrus results in the sulci of the inner aspect of the cerebrum to be found to radiate outwards from the third ventricle instead of their normal appearance surrounding the corpus. Imaging is usually performed by midline sagittal MRI in order to fully demonstrate the extent of callosal dysgenesis, coronal views to best visualize Probst bundles if present, and axial views which  demonstrate colpocephaly.  T1, T2, FLAIR, and proton density enhanced scans can all be used in conjunction with each other to best visualize the anatomy of the lesion and its surrounding parts.\n\nTherapy for this condition depends completely upon the clinical presentation of the disease, along with any associated syndromes. Due to the wide range of presenting factors, some individuals may go their entire life unaware of their lesion, while others may present at birth.  Due to this fact and the varying degree of callosal absence, treatment must be directed at the specific clinical symptoms and not towards the lesion itself.", "keywords": "corpus callosumagenesis", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1236_synpic26278", "MPX1236_synpic26279", "MPX1236_synpic26280"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1236_synpic26278", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1236_synpic26278.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Nerve, central", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1-weighted sagittal image demonstrating agenesis of Corpus callosum, absent cingulate gyrus, and incidental arachnoid cyst.", "age": "60", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.1", "figure_part": "c"}, {"image_id": "MPX1236_synpic26279", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1236_synpic26279.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - PDW Proton Density", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Nerve, central", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2-weighted MR image demonstrates colpocephaly and typical ventricular appearance in agenesis of corpus callosum.", "age": "60", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.1", "figure_part": "b"}, {"image_id": "MPX1236_synpic26280", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1236_synpic26280.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - PDW Proton Density", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Nerve, central", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Proton density-weighted MR image demonstrates colpocephaly and typical ventricular appearance in agenesis of corpus callosum.", "age": "60", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.1", "figure_part": "a"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nThis 60 year old man presents with a 4 month history of left side numbness, decreased sensation, and pain in the V2/V3 distribution of his face.

Some believe that hemangiomas are neoplasms while others consider them hamartomas.  Abnormal angiogenesis involving cytokines, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is suspected. They most often occur in the skin or subcutaneous tissues. Visceral hemangiomas are much less common but may result in organ dysfunction. They also occur in deep soft tissues and bones. Other diseases are associated with hemangiomas. Gorham disease is a process of massive osteolysis, which is believed to be within the spectrum of hemangiomatous disease. Hemangiomas occurring with multiple enchondromas exist in Maffucci syndrome.\n\nSkeletal muscle is the most common site for hemangioma of the deep soft tissue. Intramuscular hemangiomas are often asymptomatic or painless and found as an incidental finding.  They may become symptomatic causing pain and swelling.   Intramuscular hemangiomas are most commonly found in young people, virtually equal in males and females. The most common location is the thigh.  The symptoms of pain and swelling due to increased blood flow through the hemangioma are often exacerbated by exercise, which results in vascular dilation. Rarely, large intramuscular hemangiomas may be associated with significant shunting of blood flow even leading to heart murmurs and/or congestive heart failure similar to that of an arteriovenous fistula. \n\nImaging:  Plain film radiography of soft tissue hemangiomas may demonstrate soft tissue density without or with phleboliths.  They may cause benign-appearing periosteal reaction or chronic cortical thickening and remodeling in adjacent bone. Cortical changes may include erosions, thickening, tunneling, and osteopenia. Phleboliths within the soft tissue mass are diagnostic but uncommon. MRI is the imaging modality of choice in concert with plain films. Hemangiomas show increased signal on both T1 and T2 weighted images, frequently with areas of signal void, which may represent fibrous tissue, phleboliths, thrombi or high flow.  These signal characteristics with a serpentine pattern of vessels and interspersed fat are diagnostic. Gadolinium enhancement is also noted.  Features separating hemangiomas from malignant soft tissue tumors include frequency of lobulation, septation, and central low-intensity dots on T2-weighted images. Hemangiomas tend to enhance markedly compared with malignant soft-tissue tumors.  Angiography demonstrates a highly vascular lesion with parallel oriented vessels. \n\nTreatment: The natural course of intramuscular hemangiomas is usually fatty replacement with gradual involution. Therefore, conservative observation is appropriate if symptoms are absent or mild.  If symptoms dictate treatment, embolization may be used to provide symptomatic relief of intramuscular hemangiomas. When surgical excision is required, embolization may be used preoperatively to decrease blood loss and recurrence. Excision can provide permanent relief. However, it is usually restricted to hemangiomas contained within a single muscle.  If complete resection is not possible they nearly always recur. Radiation has been used as a non-surgical therapy.  Chemotherapy has been used for extensive hemangiomatosis.

Although this patient had no known history of hypertension, her CT and MRI both demonstrate evidence of chronic small vessel ischemia secondary to longstanding hypertension.  The differential diagnosis for a hemorrhagic lesion in the putamen/posterior capsule includes lacunar infarct, hypertensive hemorrhage, vascular malformation, and neoplasm.\n\nLacunar infarcts represent 15-20% of all strokes, and appear as small cavitary lesions in subcortical regions.  They result from the thrombosis of a small penetrating artery, often as a result of a chronic hypertensive change known as lipohyalinosis.  Characteristic locations for lacunar infarcts include the following:  putamen (37%), pons (16%), thalamus (14%), caudate (10%), and internal capsule (10%).  Posterior limb lacunes are the most important clinically because of their potential for severe motor and sensory deficits.  Anterior limb lacunes are often clincally silent.\nThese \"perforating\" arteries (lenticulostriate aa., thalamogeniculate aa., and anterior choroidal branch of ICA) are common sites for both lacunar infarcts and hypertensive hemorrhage, and both types of lesions can result from a process known as lipohyalinosis.  This is the impregnation of hyaline-lipid material into the walls of small arteries in the setting of hypertension combined with atherosclerosis.  Lipohyalinosis predisposes the artery to thrombosis and may also weaken the vessel wall, resulting in small dissecting \"Charcot-Bouchard\" aneurysms.\n\nHypertensive hemorrhages are slightly less common than lacunar infarcts, representing 10-15% of all strokes.  Two-thirds of hypertensive hemorrhages occur in the putamen, but most cases occur in the presence of systolic blood pressures much higher than 170.

If detected early there is typically no evidence of disease in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nThe true incidence of PIOL is yet to be defined, though it is thought to be more rare than PCNSL which has an incidence of 1/100,000. The patients at greatest risk of developing both PCNSL and PIOL are immunocompromised individuals. Recent studies suggests a possible underlying infectious etiology such as the presence of human herpesvirus 8 and Epstein-Barr virus. \n\nThe median age of onset is the fifth or sixth decade of life with an age range of 15-85.\nTypically the patients present with slowly worsening blurred vision and/or floaters present in their visual field. The disorder usually is present bilaterally (80%) but often has an asymmetric presentation. Initially most patients are diagnosed with chronic uveitis or posterior uveitis and the true diagnosis may delayed for several years.\n\nPIOL has been shown to be predominantly a B cell lymphoma which accumulate behind the retina producing a characteristic subretinal yellow infiltrate \"mound.\" The vitreous cavity contains a cellular infiltrate composed of neoplastic and reactive inflammatory cells.\n\nThe initial workup includes a chest radiograph, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood chemistries. Neuroimaging of the brain and orbits is required along with a lumbar puncture. MRI is not a good modality for revealing PIOL in the orbits. However it is very useful for seeing extensions of the primary tumor into the CNS as seen in this case. Typically the tumor cells can follow the optic nerve into the CNS proper and invade the surrounding structures. Typically, extension into the brain is accompanied by a neurologic deficit.\n\nIn the past the primary treatment of PIOL has been optic radiation. Despite a good clinical response rate of(60-100%) most patients do not opt for radiation due to the associated morbidities. Complications include radiation retinopathy, optic neuropathy, dry eyes, corneal epithelial defects, cataracts, glaucoma and a high incidence of recurrence. \n\nThe mainstay of chemotherapy is intra-vitreous injections of methotrexate.

It occurs in both sexes with equal frequency and usually after the age of 40 years. It is found most often in the extremities. Pain is a late symptom related to the increasing mass size. Often the tumor grows slowly, but an occasional anaplastic tumor may grow rapidly. Physical examination reveals a mass with boundaries that may be ill defined. (Canale: Campbell's Operative Orthopaedics, 10th ed., Mosby, Inc 2003.).      On radiographs, the presence of radiolucent fat in liposarcomas suggests a more differentiated form whereas soft tissue density is more consistent with more aggressive forms. (Reznick: Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disorders, 4th ed. W.B. Saunders Co. 2002). On T1-weighted MR images, differentiatied liposarcomas show extensive areas of high signal intensity consistent with their fat content. Areas of low signal intensity and septae in lipomatous tumors suggest more aggressive lesions.  On T2-weighted MR images with fat saturation, less differentiated liposarcomas show areas of high signal intensity whereas the differentiated fat is low signal intensity. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows enhancement of the more malignant regions of the liposarcoma.  At MRI, the myxoid areas of myxoid liposarcoma characteristically show high signal intensity areas on T2-weighted images that do not enhance after contrast. (Shapeero: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging for soft tissue sarcomas. in Seminars in Musculoskeletal Radiology, Vol.3 No.2, 1999)     At gross pathology, liposarcomas are large and lobulated and many are encapsulated.  At histology, liposarcomas are divided into  well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic and dedifferentiated subtypes varying from the low-grade malignant type (well-differentiated)  to myoid subtype of intermediate grade and the pleomorphic, round cell, and dedifferentiated of higher grades.

It is rarely seen in patients younger than 10 years of age or older than 50 years. There are two forms of OCD, the juvenile form affects children with open physes between the ages of 5 to 15 years. The adult form is present in patients with closed physes. \n     With OCD of the talus, patients present with complaints of ankle \"catching\" with active motion or walking. They may have swelling or pain depending of the stage of lesion. On physical examination, patients may have diffuse or well-defined tenderness with a joint effusion, pain with tibiotalar joint compression, and/or crepitus with dorsiflexion or plantar flexion.The cartilaginous and subchrondral bone lesions are usually on the posteromedial or the anterolateral talar aspect. \n     OCD of the talus is likely due to trauma causing tibiotalar subluxation with subsequent impingement of the talus on the tibia or fibula. Berndt and Harty observed in cadavers that impaction of the talus on the fibula in inversion with the ankle positioned in dorsiflexion results in anterolateral talar lesions. Posteromedial lesions could be created after inversion with a plantar-flexed ankle with resulting talus impaction and twisting on the posterior aspect of tibia.\n    Radiographs may be adequate for diagnosis but they may also show no findings. Radiographs should always be obtained, but if negative, an MRI  should be done for confirming the suspected clinical diagnosis when necessary. AP, lateral, and mortise radiographs are the standard radiologic images. Berndt and Harty's radiographic classification of OCD of the talus is used for determining the type of  treatment and the prognosis. Stage I is a small area of compression of subchondral bone. Stage II is a partially detached osteochondral fragment. Stage III is a completely detached fragment that remains in underlying bone depression. Stage IV is a completely detached fragment with displacement from the subchondral bone depression.\n     Canale and Belding recommend the following for all Berndt and Harty talar lesions:\nStage I and II - conservative treatment and protected weight-bearing\nStage III anterolateral – operative debridement and curettage\nStage III posteromedial –immobilize limb in cast or brace and no weight-bearing for six months\nStage IV - operative debridement and curettage", "keywords": "Talar osteochondritis dissecansOsteochondritisTalar trauma", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2351_synpic45942", "MPX2351_synpic45943", "MPX2351_synpic45944"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2351_synpic45942", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2351_synpic45942.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "T1-weighted MR image shows focus of low signal intensity in the medial aspect of the left talus.", "age": "35", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2351_synpic45943", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2351_synpic45943.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Sagittal FSE T2-weighted MR image with fat saturation shows focus of high signal intensity in the anteromedial aspect of the left talus.", "age": "35", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2351_synpic45944", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2351_synpic45944.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Axial T1-weighted MR imaging ten years later shows focus of decreased signal intensity at the anteromedial talar dome.", "age": "35", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n35 year old active duty Air Force male nordic skiier (National Ski Patrol European Division) who was training for advanced mountaineering expeditions on the Concordia Glacier presents with ankle pain.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nThe patient has point tenderness on the talus and has 12 degrees of pronation bilaterally.

However, when gouty tophi present as soft-tissue masses in the absence of articular disease, the tophi may be confused with a neoplastic process. In this instance, MRI evaluation is necessary. Tophaceous deposition should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a mass displays heterogeneous low to intermediate signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighting and a variable enhancement pattern, especially if multiple foci exist around the knee joint such as in this individual. Remarkably, the adjacent bone to these particular tophi did not show typical erosive changes, which is an unexpected finding in a patient with a chronic history of gout and knee pain. As such, needle biopsy was necessary to rule out a neoplastic and chronic infectious etiology.", "topic_title": "Tophaceous gout", "acr_code": "4.2", "category": "Metabolic (see also Toxic)", "disease_discussion": "Associations/Predisposing  Factors: Nonmodifiable risk factors include age and sex. Gout prevalence increases in direct association with age; the increased longevity of populations in industrialized nations may contribute to a higher prevalence of gout through the disorder's association with aging-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome and hypertension, and treatments for these diseases such as thiazide diuretics for hypertension. Modifiable risk factors for gout include obesity, the use of certain medications, high purine intake, and consumption of purine-rich alcoholic beverages.\n\nCommon  Locations: acute gout is most often seen in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. Tophi are chalky deposits of sodium urate that are large enough to be seen on radiographs and may occur at virtually any site. The most common sites include the joints of the hands or feet.\n\nRadiology: MR imaging is not routinely used for evaluation of tophaceous gout. However, gout may present clinically in an atypical or confusing manner. A gouty tophus occasionally mimics an infectious or neoplastic process and MR imaging may be helpful under these circumstances. On magnetic resonance imaging, tophi usually have low signal intensity on both TI- and T2-weighted images and a variable enhancement pattern.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: Gout affects everyone differently. Some people have one episode and never have further progression of disease. Others have several episodes along with chronic pain and progressive joint damage. There is no cure for gout, but it can be controlled with medication. Proper treatment can help avoid attacks and long-term joint damage.", "keywords": "gouttophi", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1710_synpic50458", "MPX1710_synpic50481", "MPX1710_synpic50503", "MPX1710_synpic50525"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1710_synpic50458", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1710_synpic50458.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A large nodular mass is seen adjacent to the lateral\nsuperior patella with heterogeneous signal on\nT2 measuring approximately 5.2 x 1.8 x 6 cm.", "age": "40", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1710_synpic50481", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1710_synpic50481.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A large nodular mass is seen adjacent to the lateral\nsuperior patella with isointense signal on T1 measuring approximately 5.2 x 1.8 x 6 cm.", "age": "40", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1710_synpic50503", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1710_synpic50503.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A large nodular mass is seen adjacent to the lateral\nsuperior patella with heterogeneous signal on\nT2 measuring approximately 5.2 x 1.8 x 6 cm.", "age": "40", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1710_synpic50525", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1710_synpic50525.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A large nodular mass is seen adjacent to the lateral\nsuperior patella with heterogeneous signal on\nT2.", "age": "40", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.2", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n40 year old male with history of gout presents with chronic knee pain for 5 months.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nRight knee findings:\n\nMinimal warmth noted. \nNo erythema.\nNo subcutaneous nodules. \nMinimally tender to palpation along joint line. \nFull range with both active and passive motion.  \nNegative anterior/posterior drawer sign.\n\nImaging Findings:\nThere is no evidence of bone marrow abnormality.

These tumors are formed by hyperproliferation of the nerve sheath cells.  Although they can occasionally undergo malignant transformation, invade CNS spaces, or cause mental retardation, significant morbidity can result from hundreds of disfiguring neurofibromas and pedunculated molluscum fibrosum visible from a long distance.  The psychological impact and physical inconvenience of such lesions cannot be overstated.  \n\tNF-1 is disease whose gene with autosomal dominant inheritance involving an NF-1 gene on chromosome 17.  However, as many as half of cases occur by spontaneous genetic defect with no known parental disease.  This genetic defect is found in nearly 1 per 3000 births with varying expression.  There is no increased incidence by sex or race.\n\tThe diagnosis is generally made in childhood or adolescence due to the appearance of caf?-au-lait macules.  The disfiguring cutaneous neurfibromas and molluscum fibrosum generally appear a few years later, but the number of cutaneous lesions may grow into the hundreds.  Diagnosis using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference Criteria can be made with two of the following:  six or more caf?-au-lait macules; two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma; axillary or inguinal freckles; bilateral optic glioma; two Lisch nodules (iris hematomas); osseous dysplasia (sphenoid wing, occipital, or tibial pseudoarthrosis); or first degree relative with NF-1.  Scoliosis is also not uncommon.\n\tRadiologic studies are not typically required for diagnosis of NF-1, but may be needed to assess lesion growth around critical nerve structures, particularly when focal neurological dysfunction is present.  Furthermore, there is an increased incidence of certain tumors (including optic gliomas, acoustic neuromas, pheochromocytomas, astrocytomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, etc.) in NF-1 patients, so there is generally a low threshold for imaging studies in symptomatic patients.  However, there is no protocol for periodic imaging unless indicated by clinical exam or for follow-up of previously identified lesions.  The T2-weighted MRI is generally the best study for imaging neurofibromas due to a large amount of water in the neurofibroma lesions. \n\tTreatment of NF-1 is primarly limited to surgical resection of symptomatic lesions, such as one at the waist line that generates pain with clothing wear.  In addition, neurofibromas which create neurological symptoms are debulked if possible.

An MRI was performed.", "exam": "", "findings": "", "differential_diagnosis": "", "diagnosis": "Alzheimer disease", "diagnosis_by": "Brain biopsy", "treatment": "", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Alzheimer disease", "acr_code": "1.9", "category": "Degenerative Disease", "disease_discussion": "1) An MRI of this patient revealed generalized cerebral atrophy with narrowed gyri and widened sulci, suggesting a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) (Figure 1).  AD, the most common cause of dementia, is a frequent occurrence among the elderly population.  Approximately 4.9 million people over the age of 65 are living with the diagnosis of AD.[1]  The disease provides a great burden to family members and has a wide impact on Medicare spending.  Although many advances have been made in providing clinical, radiographic, and biomarker evidence for AD diagnosis, the disease is only definitively diagnosed by brain biopsy or at autopsy.  \n\nGross pathologic exam of the AD patient at autopsy reveals diffuse cerebral atrophy (Figure 2), most prominently in the medial temporal lobes.  Histological exam reveals senile plaques composed of an amyloid β (Aβ) core (Figure 3).  Aβ is also seen deposited in cerebral vessel walls of AD patients.  Histological evaluation at autopsy additionally reveals neurofibrillary tangles (Figure 4) within the cerebral parenchyma, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.[2]\n\nAD is also associated with degeneration in the basal forebrain and a resulting loss of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  This loss of acetylcholine is closely related to memory deficits.[3]  As such, the major class of pharmacologic therapy for AD focuses on inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine.  While some relief from AD symptoms is seen with the use of this class of medication, the long-term progression of the disease does not appear to be altered.\n\nPatients with AD have been distinguished from age-matched controls by a significant bilateral reduction in blood flow or metabolism in the temporoparietal cortex using functional neuroimaging.[4]  Additionally, perfusion and diffusion-weighted MR imaging illustrate a bilateral reduction in perfusion in the sensorimotor regions in patients with AD.[4]  The radiographic evidence of hypoperfusion in these regions is consistent with the clinical presentation of AD, namely impairment of recent memory formation, language deficits, and difficulty executing previously learned motor processes.\n\nVarious radiographic measurement techniques have been attempted for relative certainty in early diagnosis of AD.   Bastos-Leite et al identified that hippocampal atrophy could be measured by T1-weighted MR imaging of hippocampal sulcus width.[5]  Furthermore, gross pathologic examination of patients with AD reveals significant bilateral atrophy of the cerebral parenchyma with widened sulci, most notably in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.\n\nAtrophy in the frontal and temporal lobe pars orbitalis is suggestive of Pick disease (PD).[6]  PD and AD may present clinically with similar features.  PD typically presents with personality changes and frontotemporal lobe atrophy, and is characterized by greater atrophy of the anterior brain than is seen in AD.[6]  A well-circumscribed lesion with a mass effect on noncontrast CT would indicate a hemorrhage or hematoma.  Multiple oval lesions seen on MRI are found in multiple sclerosis and are frequently found in the periventricular white matter.[7]  Structural changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta are characteristic of Parkinson disease.  Parkinson disease structural changes can be detected through MR imaging while positron emission tomography can be used to measure dopa uptake into the striatum.[8]\n\n2.  Central to the degeneration seen in AD is an accumulation of Aβ peptides, derived from amyloid β precursor protein (A?PP).[9]  These peptides have been found deposited throughout the extracellular space of AD plaques and have thus been used as an important pathological marker for AD.[9]  While a correlation between A? and AD has been identified, A? is not strictly localized to the central nervous system and is seen in many other organs including lung, liver, heart, and spleen.[9]  The accumulation of A? in cerebral parenchyma has been shown to be neurotoxic [10,11] and likely contributes to spectrum of clinical features observed in AD.\n\nLewy bodies are aggregates of α-synuclein most commonly found in Parkinson disease.  Astroglia are supportive cells of the central nervous system and an abundance of these cells would be associated with an astrocytoma.  Sphingolipid accumulation is seen in Niemann-Pick disease.  N-acetyl aspartate is used as a marker of neurons and a decrease is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.\n\n3.  Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a protein that is involved in the metabolism of cholesterol and is synthesized by astrocytes.  The gene is located on chromosome 19 and is thought to play a role in the repair of injured nerves.[12]  Of the four APOE alleles, the one with the closest association to AD is ε4.  Many studies have suggested a correlation between APOE ε4 and AD memory impairment, most significantly in older adults.[12]  APOE encodes a protein that, within the extracellular space, binds cholesterol and becomes incorporated into myelin and cell membranes.  As such, this protein is believed to be involved in the generation of neural synapses.[12]\n\nSynaptic degradation resulting from the mutated apoE ε4 allele and defective synaptogenesis may play a role in the atrophy of the corpus collosum in AD.[13]  The degeneration of the corpus collosum and cingulate gyrus in AD is reflected in the apparent deficits in intrahemispheric connection.[13]  The role of an APOE ε4 mutation has been associated with AD as a significant risk factor for developing sporadic AD as well as earlier age of onset of the disease.  Although these associations have been established, the role of APOE ε4 as a biomarker is still in question as not all patients with the ε4 allele develop AD.  Similarly, patients lacking the ε4 allele are not excluded from developing sporadic AD.[14]\n\nA mutation in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene is seen in Niemann-Pick disease.  The superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Kinesin family member 1B (KIF1B) mutations have been linked to the peripheral nerve disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.  β-Hexosaminidase A, α subunit (HEXA) mutations are seen in association with Tay-Sachs disease.\n\n4.  Patients suffering from AD exhibit pathological changes in the brain including a diffuse loss of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus.[15]  This neurological degradation leads to clinical memory loss and dementia.  The hippocampus functions in memory formation and a loss of neurons leads to difficulty forming new memories.  The loss of neurons in these regions correlates to the pathologic and neuroradiological findings of cerebral atrophy.  As noted above, cerebral atrophy is prominent in the brain of a patient with AD at autopsy, particularly in the medial temporal lobes.[5]  Loss of neurons in alternate brain regions, including hypothalamus, cerebellum, and mammillary bodies are not associated with AD pathology. \n\n5.  The major histological diagnostic findings at autopsy of a patient with AD are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Two cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, Aβ and tau, have been validated in association with AD and can be used to distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease.[16]  An elevation in neurotoxic Aβ leads to the deposition of Aβ plaques in the cerebral parenchyma (leading to the accumulation of senile plaques) as well as in the walls of cerebral blood vessels.[2]  The neurofibrillary tangle (Figure 3), another pathologic finding in AD, consists of an aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.[2]\n\nAmyloid precursor protein is normally cleaved by α-secretase to yield multiple fragments that are chiefly eliminated from the brain.  Abnormal cleavage results from a mutation in the amyloid precursor protein, resulting in cleavage by both β-secretase and γ-secretase, leading to aggregations of abnormally cleaved Aβ with other proteins such as tau, apoE, and presenilin 1 and 2.  These aggregates form the basis for senile plaques (Figure 3) in AD pathology.[17]\n\nAmyloid association with AD has been further established through the exploration of early AD development in adults with Down syndrome.  Down syndrome (trisomy 21) patients living into adulthood have been found to develop senile plaques with Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex at a significantly younger age than individuals without Down syndrome.  The findings of early development of plaques and tangles in association with a duplicate chromosome 21 lead to further linkage studies that proposed an association between the chromosome and AD pathology.  These studies found that mutations in a region of the 21st chromosome, near the gene encoding β-amyloid and duplicated in trisomy 21, have been associated with familial early-onset AD.[17]\n\nThe presence of biomarkers in the CSF other than amyloid β and tau have not been found in association with AD.  Cystatin C is more closely associated with renal function than with neurodegeneration.  α-synuclein is related to Lewy bodies found in patients with Parkinson disease and not a known AD biomarker.  Fibrillin-1 is a gene associated with the connective tissue disorder Marfan syndrome.  Secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPP-α) is related to the response of microglia to chronic inflammation and found in AD, yet has not been established as a significant biomarker.[18]", "keywords": "AlzheimerNeurodegenerativeatrophy", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1363_synpic43239"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1363_synpic43239", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1363_synpic43239.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "There is global atrophy.", "age": "84", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nAn 84-year-old man presents with a 3-year history of progressive memory loss, dementia, and difficulty communicating as noted by his family.

It frequently co-exists with other pelvic diseases.  It represents focal or diffuse invasion of the basal endometrium into the myometrium causing a reactive hyperplasia amidst small foci of entrapped glandular elements and hemorrhage.   Basal endometria is not responsive to menstrual cycle hormonal fluctuations and thus the thickness of the endometrial layer does not vary with the menstrual cycle.  The disease is sometimes referred to as “endometriosis interna”.\n\nWomen with adenomysis present with the nonspecific symptoms of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.

The MR image will show loss of the normal uterine junctional zone.  It is instead expanded and replaced with focal or diffuse low T1 and T2 tissue signal, the thickness of which correlates well with the severity of adenomyosis.  A junctional zone thickness of between 10 – 12 mm is a commonly accepted criterion for diagnosis.  A requirement for greater thickness provides increased specificity.  The low T2 signal is due to the proliferation of reactive smooth muscle elements in response to the endometrial invasion and a generally decreased vascularity of these areas.  Linear striations of high T2 signal radiating from the endometrium are specific for adenomyosis.  One may also see small foci of increased T2 signal.

Typical locations include on the ovaries (76%), anterior and posterior cul-de-sac (69%), posterior broad ligament (47%), uterosacral ligament (36%), uterus (11%), colon (4%) and small bowel (0.5%). Women of childbearing age are affected and the mean age of diagnosis is 25-29. The overall prevalence of endometriosis in woman is estimated to be 5-10%. Clinical manifestations include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, abdominal pain, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and infertility.  Small implants and adhesions are not well evaluated radiologically; therefore, laparoscopy remains the standard of reference for diagnosis and staging.  \n\nAn endometrioma may be defined as an area of endometriosis, usually in the ovary, that has enlarged sufficiently to be classified as a tumor or cyst.  It develops secondary to a deep endometriotic implant that undergoes repeated hemorrhage. It can completely replace normal ovarian tissue.  If large enough to see by ultrasound the mass typically has homogenous low-level echoes -- a non-specific appearance which can also be seen with entities such as hemorrhagic cysts and malignancy. A recent study (Patel et al) noted that 95% of endometriomas in their study exhibited this typical appearance on ultrasound. Although endometriomas frequently contain septations, the absence of wall nodularity and presence of diffuse low level echoes favors endometrioma over malignancy.  The appearance of endometriomas can mimic neoplasm including wall thickening, septations, wall nodularity and echogenic wall foci.   Detection of endometriosis implants and adhesions by ultrasound is not practical due to their small size and large variety of appearances.   Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic cysts, dermoid cysts and cystic neoplasms.   Resolution of a cystic lesion on a follow-up ultrasound effectively rules out endometrioma.  Because of the wide variability of ultrasound appearance of endometriomas pelvic MRI can be very helpful. \n\nThe appearance of endometriomas on MRI is more specific than other non-invasive imaging methods.  Imaging planes can include all three standard projections (axial, sagittal, and coronal), with the sagittal plane being particularly useful for evaluating the cul-de-sac and rectum. Endometriomas appear hyperintense on T1-weighted images.  On T2 weighted images they display heterogenous “shading” or loss of signal intensity compared with T1 weighted images which is due to the chronic cyclical nature of its blood products and helps differentiate it from other lesions with more acute hemorrhage. The findings on T2 weighted sequence are variable and depend on the concentration of blood products.   Fat suppression increases the conspicuity of endometriomas and allows more detailed evaluation of their architecture.  This is especially helpful in differentiating endometriomas from fat-containing lesions such as dermoid cysts.  Gadolinium iv contrast enhancement is not particularly useful for differentiating endometriomas from other lesions as endometriomas have non-specific variable enhancement. Dermoids can be recognized and differentiated from endometriomas by the presence of chemical shift artifact and signal drop-out on the fat-suppression images.

They are strongly associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.  10-20% of hemangioblastomas occur with VHL syndrome and approximately 45% of patients with VHL syndrome eventually develop a hemangioblastoma.  95% of hemangioblastomas occur in the posterior fossa (fewer than 100 case reports exist of supratentorial locations), and overall they account for 7-12% of all posterior fossa tumors in adults (including primary and metastatic tumors). \n\nPathologically, hemangioblastomas are highly vascular tumors comprised primarily of capillaries and pericytes (aka “stromal” cells).  While their World Health Organization classification remains under tumors of uncertain histogenesis, hemangioblastomas may arise from embryonic plexus epithelium based upon their expression of transthyretin and transferrin.  They are typically well circumscribed, with 60% being cystic with a mural nodule and 40% being solid.  Their solid/nodular component is composed of tightly packed blood vessels varying in size from capillaries to cavernous, with the nidus of the tumor abutting the pial surface.  Hemangioblastomas do not have a capsule, and when cystic, their wall is composed of compressed neural glial cells.  The associated cystic fluid is xanthochromic, with a concentration of amino acids, alkaline phosphates, and mucoproteins similar to that of blood, suggesting origination from diffusion from the solid vascular component of the tumor.\n\nHemangioblastomas are rare in children and typically present during the third to fifth decade.  They typically grow slowly and clinical presentation depends upon the tumor size and location.  Posterior fossa tumors can present with minor neurological symptoms for months followed by an acute exacerbation.  The most common symptoms include: headache, vomiting, and ataxia.  A distinguishing clinical presentation of hemangioblastomas is their potential to present with polycythemia secondary to tumoral production of erythropoietin.  This occurs in approximately 20% of posterior fossa tumors, and is more commonly seen in solid hemangioblastomas.  Surgical resection is considered standard of care, however recurrence is seen in approximately 25% of cases, most frequently in association with VHL syndrome.\n\nCT evaluation of hemangioblastomas classically demonstrates a large, low density, cystic-appearing cerebellar mass.  The addition of intravenous contrast material greatly increases the ability to identify a strongly enhancing mural nodule adjacent to the pial surface.  Solid tumors enhance strongly and uniformly.  During angiography, the common pattern is a large avascular posterior fossa mass with a small, highly vascular mural nodule.  A prolonged vascular stain is typical.  MR imaging reveals the cystic component with a low signal on T1-weighted sequences and a high signal on T2-weighted sequences.  The solid/nodular component is variable in its signal characteristics, and typically is heterogeneously isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences.  Intense enhancement following gadolinium is typical.

At the time of injury, the tibia translates anteriorly relative to the femur resulting in an impaction injury of the lateral femoral condyle against the posterior tibial plateau. Identification of the “deep” sulcus on the lateral radiograph of the knee is a clear indicator of significant trauma and has a high association with ACL disruption.", "topic_title": "The Deep Lateral Femoral Notch: A Sign of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Disruption", "acr_code": "4.4", "category": "Trauma", "disease_discussion": "Several apparently minor osseous abnormalities of the knee have been described on conventional radiographs that are associated with more serious but radiographically occult soft tissue injuries. These include avulsion fracture of the anterior tibial spine and avulsion fracture of the lateral tibial plateau (Segond fracture), both associated with ACL disruption and avulsion fracture of the posterior intercondylar insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament (2-4). The deep femoral sulcus sign, however, is the most common radiographic sign associated with ligamentous injury of the knee. Because it is an impaction injury rather than an avulsion injury, it can be a subtle finding on radiographs, and one that is often overlooked.\n\nA normal lateral radiograph of the knee demonstrates a normal shallow groove along the lateral femoral condyle that is formed by the junction of the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral curvatures. This notch is referred to as the lateral condylopatellar sulcus and it is normally smooth and symmetric in appearance measuring less than 1.5 mm in depth (5). During the pivot shift mechanism of injury, the knee while in slight flexion undergoes a twisting injury and valgus stress that leads to disruption of the ACL thus allowing anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. As the tibia and femur return to their normal position, the lateral femoral condyle impacts the posterolateral tibial plateau resulting in an osteochondral impaction fracture of the lateral femoral condyle.\n\nThe radiograph will demonstrate an irregular asymmetric appearing notch that is greater than 2 mm in depth. This is referred to as the “deep lateral femoral sulcus” sign. The depth of the notch is measured by drawing a line tangential to the sulcus along the articular surface of the lateral femoral condyle and then by measuring the distance from the line to the depth of the sulcus (Fig 5). The presence of a deep lateral femoral sulcus is nearly always associated with ACL disruption but lacks sensitivity; the absence of the sign therefore does not exclude the presence of an ACL tear (5).\n\nMR imaging also demonstrates an irregular appearing deep lateral femoral sulcus and in addition it will demonstrate marrow edema within the lateral femoral condyle and the posterior tibial plateau secondary to the impaction injury (6). This pattern of marrow edema has been referred to as the “pivot shift” marrow edema pattern and is also highly specific for ACL injury. See figures 2, 3 and 4 for examples in our case. MR imaging will demonstrate the ACL disruption along with associated injuries of internal derangement to include meniscal tear, chondral injury and collateral ligament tear.\n\nThe “deep lateral femoral sulcus” sign is a subtle radiographic finding that when present on a plain film can provide an important clue that an ACL injury has occurred. It results from an impaction of the lateral femoral condyle against the posterior tibial plateau at the time of ACL disruption. Identification of this finding on radiographs of the knee should prompt further evaluation of the knee with MR imaging.", "keywords": "Anterior cruciate ligament disruptionDeep lateral femoral notch", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2300_synpic31225", "MPX2300_synpic31226", "MPX2300_synpic31227"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2300_synpic31225", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2300_synpic31225.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - Other Pulse Seq.", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Sagittal STIR image through the lateral femoral condyle demonstrate a deep irregular appearing lateral femoral sulcus.

Follow up MR imaging demonstrates marrow edema in the lateral femoral condyle and in the posterior tibial plateau. The lateral femoral sulcus appears deepened and irregular in contour. T2-weighted sagittal image through the region of the intercondylar notch demonstrates complete disruption of the anterior cruciate ligament (Fig 2).", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

They account for 15-20% of all primary brain tumors. They are most commonly found in the parasagittal dura, convexities, sphenoid wing, cerebellopontine angle cistern, and olfactory groove.  Up to 90% are supratentorial, and 1% occur outside the CNS (presumably due to arachnoid rests).  Less than 10% cause symptoms, with the majority discovered incidentally or at autopsy or on brain imaging.\n\nOn CT, they are typically hyperdense, with up to 20% demonstrating calcification.  On MR, they are typically well-circumscribed and iso- to hypointense on T1, iso- to hyperintense on T2, and strongly enhancing.  A dural tail is seen in up to 72%, which is thought to represent a neoplastic infiltration or a reactive fibrovascular proliferation of the meninges.  This finding is suggestive but not specific, however.  Similarly, a distinct cleft of arachnoid with trapped CSF and vessels is common.  Meningiomas typically take one of two forms, either “globose” (spherical) or “en plaque” (flat).\n\nMeningiomas may encase and narrow vessels, and incite a varying amount of edema, depending on location (cerebral cortical lesions have more edema, basal cisterns – less).  Bony changes may be hyperostotic or osteolytic, mimicking Paget’s or fibrous dysplasia.  On angiography, the “in-law” sign has been described (coming early and staying late) with an early blush and delayed washout.  Due to their vascularity, preoperative embolization can be performed (particularly at the skull base, where the lesions may be unresectable).\n\nMalignant meningiomas, a rare variant, demonstrate rapid growth or intraparenchymal invasion.

Initial radiographs of the hips may not show any changes, as in this case.  Therefore, clinical suspicion should be high for this disorder in a patient whose history suggests the diagnosis.  Avascular necrosis is caused by a number of etiologies including femoral neck fracture, alcohol use, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, radiation treatment, and prolonged corticosteroid administration, as in this patient.  Steroids have been implicated in about 20 to 35 percent of cases.  The occurrence also appears to be directly related to the dosage level and duration of the medication.  In decreasing order of frequency, the most common locations of steroid-induced avasular osteonecrosis are the femoral head, humeral head, the distal end of the femur, and the proximal part of the tibia.  \n\nThe pathogenesis of steroid-induced osteonecrosis is unclear.  However several mechanisms have been proposed and include both mechanical and vascular etiologies.  Osteoporosis resulting in microfractures and later bone collapse is one mechanical theory.  Vascular compromise due to hyperviscosity, vasculitis, fat embolization, and compression from marrow accumulation of relatively inelastic fat cells are also other possible causes.\n  \nThe most common presenting symptom of avascular necrosis is pain.  Groin pain and less commonly thigh and buttock pain are seen in patients with femoral head involvement.  Patients may also complain of pain upon weight bearing.  Thirty to fifty percent have bilateral involvement.  Physical exam usually is nonspecific and may demonstrate limited range of motion particularly in abduction and internal rotation.\n\nRadiographic evaluation of a patient with suspected osteonecrosis includes an AP and frog-leg radiograph of both hips.  As mentioned above, the initial radiographs may not show any evidence of disease.  Subsequently, radiographic findings show sclerosis, indistinctive trabecular pattern, and patchy osteoporosis.  Progressive radiograph findings include a crescentic subchondral line indicative of subchondral collapse, segmental flattening of the femoral head, and ultimately joint space narrowing, acetabular degenerative changes, and collapse of the femoral head.\n\nMR imaging is the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis.  As with this patient, MR imaging showed evidence of osteonecrosis prior to the radiographs.  T1-weighted images typically show a line of low signal intensity, which corresponds to the presence of granulation tissue and sclerotic bone.  T2-weighted images typically demonstrate a double line sign, which consists of a narrower line of low signal intensity that corresponds to bone sclerosis and an inner zone of high signal intensity that corresponds to granulation tissue.   \n\nReferences\nLaPorte et al.  “Multifocal Osteonecrosis.”  Journal of Rheumatology.  25(10), Oct 1998, pp 1968-74. \nDonald Resnick.

It is an idiopathic disease most often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis and less often Crohn’s disease. It less frequently associated with Reidel’s thyroiditis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, or mediastinal fibrosis. The disease is more common in males than females with a 3:1 incidence ratio. The estimated prevalence in Western countries is 6 to 8 cases per 100,000 persons.\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of PSC, however, it is remains an idiopathic disease. Bile duct walls become progressively inflamed and thickened and the degree of severity may vary segmentally.  There is typically alternating dilatation and stricturing of the involved ducts. The disease usually involves both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. It is characterized by progressive destruction of bile ducts, which may result in the development of biliary cirrhosis. It was previously thought to be a rare disorder, however, now PSC is one of the more common indications for liver transplantation.\n\nThe main symptoms of PSC include pruritis, jaundice, abdominal pain, and fatigue. However, as many as 44% of patients may be asymptomatic at presentation. Patients may also experience repeated episodes of bacterial cholangitis and have an increased tendency to develop pigmented biliary stones. Steatorrhea and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins may occur. Cholangiocarcinoma may occur in up to 30% of PSC patients.  2% of patient’s may also develop hepatocellular carcinoma. \n\nThe diagnosis of PSC is based on characteristic ERCP findings in combination with laboratory, histologic, and clinical findings. It is important to exclude secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis, such as prior surgeries, choledocolithiasis, chronic bacterial cholangitis and biliary neoplasms. The typical  ERCP findings of PSC include multifocal strictures and dilatations that have a beaded appearance. Biliary diverticulae may also be present. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are usually involved, but either alone may be affected. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) also shows promise as a valuable technique in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with PSC and MRCP may be superior to ERCP for the demonstration of intrahepatic ductal findings. CT and ultrasonography play a more limited role in the diagnosis or followup of PSC  and demonstrate nonspecific findings. \n\nMany modalities have been investigated for the treatment of PSC in an attempt to delay disease progression. Immunosupressants, corticosteroids, antifibrogenic agents, endoscopic management and limited surgical management are used with limited success.

They may be found in intracranial and intraspinal compartments.  In the head, meningiomas are most commonly located in frontal, parasagittal, and parietal convexities (50% of cases). Less than 10% of tumors are infratentorial; multiple meningiomas occur less than 10% of the time.  Clinical presentation is varied, depending on particular structures compressed by the mass. Headache and visual changes are frequently reported.  A large number of patients with meningiomas are asymptomatic.\n\nOrigins, Growth, and Histology\nThe majority of meningiomas are histologically benign tumors, arising from the cap cells of the arachnoid layer. In many cases, serial imaging studies have revealed a cessation of growth after the time of initial tumor detection. These tumors project inward from the dura, and can cause clinically significant effects due to compression of surrounding neurological structures.  A variety of classification systems based on cytology and histopathology are used with meningiomas.  While the overwhelming majority of meningiomas are histologically benign, the malignant type may result in rapid, widespread infiltration with small (microscopic) \"finger\" projections into adjacent cortex.  In patients with malignant meningiomas, marked deficits in physical and mental status may culminate in death.\n\nRadiological Findings\nPlain films may reveal hyperostosis, erosion, or calcification adjacent to tumor site.  Noncontrast CT's of meningiomas often reveal sharply demarcated, rounded, homogenous masses with slightly increased density when compared to surrounding cortex.  Up to 10% of meningiomas may appear isodense with respect to surrounding brain.  CT may reveal focal cerebral atrophy, edema, or widening of subarachnoid spaces, direct effects of tumor compression of surrounding structures.  Contrast enhanced CT most often reveals homogenous enhancement in approximately 85% of cases.\n\nOn MRI, T1 images are often hypo- or isointense; T2 images often reveal isointense or slightly hyperintense masses. Gadolinium increases signal intensity of meningiomas. A  \"dural tail\" consisting of tissue tapering into the dura may be appreciated.  Imaging studies may reveal extension of mass into cortical structures, or invasion of the calvarium. Angiography often reveals a homogenous, hypervascular pattern.\n\n\nTreatment Options\nA variety of clinical and experimental treatment options exist, including surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.  Resection is the most widely utilized treatment option, although advanced age, concern about loss of neurological function due to surgery, advanced age, and being a poor surgical candidate preclude some from surgical options. Tumor embolization may be employed 3-5 days prior to surgery in an attempt to decrease blood supply to the meningioma. Recurrence of tumor is a possibility after resection. Complete removal of initial tumor and all affected bone results in recurrence rates of less than 10%.\n\nRadiotherapy is often employed during the presurgical period.  Likewise radiotherapy after incomplete resection of a meningioma may be of considerable benefit to patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery with a \"gamma knife\" has shown decrease in tumor size in approximately 50% of cases.  Since this technology is relatively new, long term outcome of gamma knife therapy is not known. Brachytherapy with iodine-125 has been described in the literature; long term outcomes have yet to be determined. Medical treatment options include recommendations of anticonvulsant prophylaxis in patients with supratentorial masses; corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling may also be warranted.  The use of traditional antineoplastic agents in treating meningiomas has not been met with great success.  Hormonal manipulation may have a beneficial effect on stopping tumor growth; research this area continues.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2142_synpic20378", "MPX2142_synpic20379", "MPX2142_synpic20380", "MPX2142_synpic20381"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2142_synpic20378", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2142_synpic20378.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1WI: hypointense to isointense circumscribed extraaxial mass located midline over the planum sphenoidale.", "age": "39", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": "1"}, {"image_id": "MPX2142_synpic20379", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2142_synpic20379.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W w/Gadolinium", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "post Gad T1WI: intensely enhancing circumscribed extraaxial mass located midline over the planum sphenoidale.", "age": "39", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": "2"}, {"image_id": "MPX2142_synpic20380", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2142_synpic20380.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2WI: centrally nectotic circumscribed extraaxial mass located midline over the planum sphenoidale.", "age": "39", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": "3"}, {"image_id": "MPX2142_synpic20381", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2142_synpic20381.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W w/Gadolinium", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "post Gad T1WI: centrally nectotic circumscribed extraaxial mass located midline over the planum sphenoidale.", "age": "39", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": "4"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n39 year-old woman with several month history of bilateral hemianopsia, worse in the morning\n\nPhysical Exam:\nseveral month history of bilateral hemianopsia\n\nImaging Findings:\nLarge cicrumscribed midline mass overlying the planum sphenoidale causing \"cortical buckling\" of adjacent brain parenchyma.

The tumor will continue to enlarge during skeletal growth, but typically becomes latent at skeletal maturity.  \n\n•  Synonyms:  Osteocartilaginous Exostosis\n\n•  Common  Locations:  The most common site of origin for an osteochondroma is the metaphysis at bony sites of tendon and ligamentous attachments.  Common sites include distal femur, proximal humerus, proximal tibia but also may occur less frequently in the pelvis, scapula, spine or any bone preformed in cartilage.\n\n•  Demographics:  Typically occur in first to third decades with prevalence greater in males than in females.  It is the most common skeletal tumor in children with an occurrence of 1 in 200.   They may be solitary or multiple and they may arise spontaneously.\n\n•  Gross  Morphology:  Osteochondromas vary in size.  The average lesion arising from tubular bones is approximately 4cm.  Osteochondromas arising from flat bones tend to be larger with a higher likelihood of malignant transformation.\n\n•  Histology:  Pathologic sections show osteochondromas to have a cartilaginous cap.  Histologically, the cartilaginous cap is identical to the physeal growth plate.  During active growth, the cap is composed of hyaline cartilage.  The thickness of the cap is correlated with the age of the patient, and the cap decreases in size as patient’s age.    In children and adolescents, the cap may be as thick as 3cm, whereas in older patients, it may be thin.  A thick cartilaginous cap (>1cm) in an adult should raise the possibility of malignant transformation (usually chondrosarcomas)\n\n•  Radiology:  Plain radiographic appearances of an osteochondroma are those of a pedunculated or sessile bony excrescence with well-defined margins.  In adults, the cartilage cap often contains flecks of calcification. Continuity of the osteochondroma with the medullary canal is a characteristic finding,  particularly obvious in long bones.   MR imaging is able to detect continuity of the cortical and medullary bone in the outgrowth with that of the parent bone.  This finding is diagnostic of an osteochondroma.  Of greatest utility in the functionality of the MR is the ability to precisely identify and measure the cartilaginous cap of an osteochondroma using T2 weighted spin echo images.  These measurements can be used to supply information regarding the likelihood of malignant changes.\n\n•  Prognosis  and  Treatment:  Most solitary osteochondromas are discovered in children and adolescents  and are painless, slow-growing masses and require no treatment.  Significant symptoms may occur as a result of complications such as fracture, bony deformity, mechanical joint problems, and vascular or neurologic compromise.

However, they can be seen at any age, and there is no gender or racial predilection. \n\nTypical symptoms include pathologic fracture or bone pain both of which our patient did not have. Often times, patients are asymptomatic. Prognosis is usually benign and cases are managed conservatively.  Malignant transformation is extremely rare (<1%) but signs include bone scalloping, cortical thickening, periosteal reaction, bony erosion all of which can be seen on imaging.", "topic_title": "Enchondroma", "acr_code": "4.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "A benign neoplasm composed of ectopic cartilage rests that have migrated into bones’ metaphysis from the growth plate. Enchondromas are usually singular, but multiple lesions may occur in enchondromatosis syndromes such as Ollier’s, Maffucci’s and metachondromatosis.  Enchondromas are a benign finding seen incidentally on plain radiographs MRI, and/or CT while investigating other pathology.\n\nTypically, patients are 20-40 years old when the tumor is identified.  The patient with any of the enchondromatosis syndromes is typically younger when the first lesion is identified. There is no gender or racial predilection.\n\nIn the United States, enchondromas account for 12-14% of benign bone neoplasms and 3-10% of osseous neoplasms in general. They are most commonly found in the diaphyses of the hands and feet, and less commonly in the femur, humerus, or tibia.  Enchondromas present as small (<5 cm) lytic masses which have a pattern of lobulated arcs and rings indicative of their chondroid matrix.  When found in the larger bones, they are usually metaphyseal, centrally located and can have a sclerotic margin.\n\nFrequently plain radiographs are adequate to identify and diagnose enchondromas.  Occasionally, further imaging such as CT or MRI may be required to offer a more complete picture of the bone surrounding the tumor.  Bone scans are usually ineffective in the diagnosis of enchondromas as typical findings of mildly increased uptake are non-specific.\n\nEnchondromas are benign but can cause pathologic fractures or can rarely progress to chondrosarcoma. This malignant transformation is of concern due to the destructive changes which occur in high grade tumors as well as the 5 year survival rate which is as low as 15% in high grade tumors.   \n\nTumors found in the hands and feet have a virtually negligible transformation rate while those seen in the long and flat bones should be monitored more closely for transformation. Transformation to malignancy occurs much more frequently in patients with enchondromatosis. \n\nThe following radiographic changes are suggestive of this transformation to chondrosarcoma:\n• \tScalloping of the inner surface of the bone\n• \tThickening of the bone cortex\n• \tReactive bone growth on the outer surface of the bone\n• \tErosion surrounded by reactive bone\n• \tNoticeable growth in the bony erosion\n• \tMRI may identify cortical extension and extension to the soft tissue mass.\n\nWith the exception of enlarged digits when hands and feet are involved, physical exam of the patient with an enchondroma is usually unremarkable. Pain found on exam is attributable to either adjacent but non-related pathology, pathologic fracture resulting from the enchondroma, or should raise the clinical suspicion for progression to chondrosarcoma.\n\nDifferential diagnosis varies depending on whether calcifications are present.  In cases in which they are, bone infarct which may exhibit a serpiginous lining and low grade chondrosarcoma must be considered.  If the lesion is purely lytic, however, non-ossifying fibroma, simple bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, eosinophilic granuloma, and clear cell chondrosarcoma should be considered. \nWhen considering these diagnoses, the following factors are each used to rule out the diagnosis in question:\n• \tNon-ossifying fibroma – usually cortically based, enchondromas are medullary based\n• \tSimple bone cyst – usually seen before age 20\n• \tEosinophilic granuloma – also seen commonly in patients before age 20\n• \tFibrous dysplasia – has a ground glass appearance on imaging\n• \tClear cell chondrosarcoma – epiphyseally based, with extension into the metaphysis usually seen on MR\n\nWhen asymptomatic, treatment of enchondromas consists of observation.

Often there is a central scar, but there is an absence of hemorrhage and necrosis.\n\nRadiologically these tumors are evaluated the same way as renal cell.  On ultrasound the oncocytoma is indistinguishable from renal cell.  Typical features on CT include a central, stellate pattern with low attentuation.  Additionally the tumor appears very homogenous.  With angiography oncocytomas have four typical signs: lucent rim, homogenous capillary nephrogram phase, absence of neoplastic vessels, and feeding arteries with a spoked wheel appearance.  While these have been used as predictors of oncocytoma, they have shown poor predictive value in differentiating oncocytoms from renal cell.  MRI is currently being evaluated for its ability to diagnose oncocytoma.  Characteristics indicative of this tumor on MR include low intensity homogenous mass on T1 that shows increased intensity on T2 with a capsule, central scar or stellate pattern and no hemorrhage or necrosis. \n\nOncocytomas are very difficult to differentiate from renal cell carcinoma both clincally and radiologically and the use of renal biposy is not recommended due to the similar histological appearance of the two entities in certain situations.

This has been noted in other cases as well.  His vestibular symptoms were transient in nature.\n\nOther CPA masses such as eidermoid includion cysts (IEC's) that don't enhance, Lipomas (T1 doesn't show fat), and Hemangiomas (hyperintense on T1 and T2, often with flow voids present as well) though in the original differential were not in the final differential as the enhancement characteristics of the MRI (as well as morphology) was essentially able to eliminate them from further consideration.  Though the mass looked morphologically like a schwannoma, there still was the possibility, though very slight, that it could be a meningioma as enhancement characteristics can be similar between meningiomas and schwannomas.  \n\nThe pathological sample however, confirmed the very strong suspicion that it was a schwannoma.", "topic_title": "Vestibular (Acoustic) Schwannoma", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "Vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic Schwannomas, acoustic neuromas, acoustic neurinomas, and vestibular neurilemomas are benign neoplasms derived from Schwann cells encompassing the vestibular (as opposed to cochlear) portion of CN VIII.  They are the most common cerebropontine angle (CPA) mass, making up approximately 80% of all CPA tumors and approximately 8% of all intracranial tumors in adults.\n\nPatients with vestibular schwannomas typically present between 30-50 years of age with the overall incidence of symptomatic vestibular schwannomas at 1/100,000 person-years, though asymptomatic lesions may be more common.  Most lesions are unilateral.  However, as many as 10% of patients with vestibular schwannomas have Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) with more than 75% of affected NF2 patients having bilateral vestibular schwannomas. \n\nMost patients present with complaints of hearing loss and/or tinnitus.  Many also complain of difficulties with balance/and or gait.  In a case series of 1000 acoustic Schwannomas, at time of diagnosis, 95% of patients had cochlear nerve symptoms, 61% had vestibular symptoms, 9% had trigeminal symptoms (most often sensory) and 6% had facial nerve complaints.  (Note that more patients had trigeminal symptoms than facial nerve symptoms, despite the close proximity of CN VII to CN VIII!)  \n\nAs most patients do have hearing loss from the affected nerve, audiometry is the most sensitive initial clinical screening test for a vestibular schwannoma.  However, HRCT or MRI (MRI with gadolinium contrast being preferable to HRCT) is needed for more definitive diagnosis.      \n   \nAcoustic schwannomas typically originate at the entrance of the internal auditory canal (IAC) and extend out into the CPA, resembling an “ice-cream cone,” often causing mass affect on other structures as they enlarge.  This origin and appearance, evident with MRI and/or HRCT, helps distinguish them from other CPA masses such as meningiomas (the 2nd most common CPA mass), epidermoid inclusion cysts (EIC’s, 3d most common CPA mass), lipomas, angiomas, arachnoid cysts, mets, etc.  \n\nIn addition to the morphology and location/origin of vestibular schwannomas, they also have enhancing characteristics that aid in distinguishing them from other CPA masses.  On T1-weighted images, schwannomas are hypointense compared to surrounding brain parenchyma, and enhance markedly with IV gadolinium.  T2-weighted images show hyperintense signal.  \n\nMeningiomas are typically isointense rather than hypointense on T1 but may be hyperintense with T2 imaging and also enhance brightly with gadolinium.  With the enhancement however, meningiomas are often more homogeneous in appearance than the more heterogeneous Schwannomas that is sometimes due to benign cystic degeneration.  Similar to Schwannomas, EIC’s are hypointense with T1 images and are hyperintense with T2.  However, EIC’s don’t enhance with gadolinium (other than occasionally a thin ring of enhancement around their periphery).\n\nWhen observation is not appropriate, treatment of vestibular schwannomas is usually surgical, though radiation therapy (stereotactic or \"Gamma Knife\" is also being used with success.

They consist of large sinusoidal vascular spaces which lack normal endothelial tight juctions.  As a result, bleeding is frequent.  The majority of bleeds from these lesions, however, are subclinical with nearly 100% demonstrating hemosiderin staining of the adjacent parenchyma at diagnosis.  There is a 0.5-1% incidence of symptomatic hemmorhage/year.  The most common clinical presentation as a result of hemmorhage is the development of seizures or progressive neurologic deficits, with a seizure disorder being the presenting symptom in approximately 50% of patients with cavernous angiomas.  The degree to which a lesion is symptomatic is,like most CNS abnormalities, dependent on location. Brainstem lesions tend to present earlier with neurologic deficits.\n\nCavernous angiomas may occur anywhere within the CNS with roughly 3/4 occurring supratentorially, 1/4 within the posterior fossa and brainstem, and occasional lesions within the spinal cord.  While the occurrence may be sporadic, there is a strong familial association identified where close to 80% of members of affected families may demonstrate lesions.  In about 50% of patients the lesions will be multiple.  Whenever more than one cavernous malformation is identified in the CNS, there is probably an autosomal dominant inheritence.  This should prompt an evaluation of all first-degree relatives.\n\nImaging findings are related to the degree of prior hemmorhage of the lesions.  On CT, these lesions may be heavily calcified.  MR often demonstrates blood products of various ages centrally and a rim of hemosiderin peripherally.

These include compression, burst, Chance (\"seatbelt\"), and fracture-dislocation.  \n\nCompression fractures show anterior column compression (anterior vertebral body) with usually no middle or post column involvement.  Burst fractures produce anterior and middle column compression (vertebral body and anterior neural arch).  Fracture-dislocations involve all three (anterior, middle, and posterior) columns which results in intervertebral subluxation or dislocation.\n\nChance or Chance-type fractures involve the posterior, middle, and occasionally the anterior columns.  The injury results from a severe flexion of the spine with the fulcrum not being the the anterior vertebral body as in compression fractures.  Instead, the anterior abdominal wall (i.e. where the lap seatbelt fits) is the fulcrum area with hyperflexion at thoraco-lumbar junction (e.g. L1). This creates a distraction force on the posterior and middle columns of the vertebra,  creating a horizontal fracture extending posterior to middle.  This fracture may then extend anteriorly throught vertebral body (with an assoc compression of anterior body).\n\nChance fracture is an  “eponym”, named after G.Q. Chance who described this injury in 1948 as anterior wedging, compression, and a frature through the body, lamina, and spinous process.

Blood flows preferentially through the AVM therefore depriving other areas of the brain of blood flow.  This steal phenomenon can produce neurological symptoms, seizures, and parenchymal loss.  This increase in blood flow also can produce aneurysms.  The location of the AVMs is 80-85% in the cerebral hemispheres and 10-15% in the posterior fossa.\n\nClinical Presentation:\nArteriovenous malformations are usually congenital developmental anomalies, but are frequently asymptomatic until 30 to 40 years of age.  Approximately 25% of these patients hemorrhage by age 15 and 80-90% of the patients are symptomatic by age 50.  Symptoms include seizure and headaches.\n\nPathology:\nArteriovenous malformations consist of feeding arteries that are dilated with a cluster of entangled vascular loops.  Blood flows preferentially through the AVM therefore depriving other areas of the brain of blood flow.  This steal phenomenon can produce neurological symptoms, seizures, and parenchymal loss.  This increase in blood flow also can produce aneurysms.  The location of the AVMs is 80-85% in the cerebral hemispheres and 10-15% in the posterior fossa.  \n\nImage Findings:\nCT scans typically show tangled vessels in the parenchyma that are high density contrast.  These vessels are noted to have a serpentine configuration.  Curvilinear or speckled calcification may also be present.  MR scans show curvilinear flow voids secondary to fast flow seen on pulse sequences and dilated feeding arteries.  The appearance of the arteries vary due to flow rate, direction, pulse sequence, and the presence and age of the hemorrhage.  Gliosis and hemorrhages also appear on the MR images.  Often MRA images are used to diagnose the disease.  MR is more sensitive to the feeding arteries, the core or nidus, and the enlarged draining veins.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\nDifferential diagnosis includes vascular malformations.  If normal blood flow is present, capillary telangiectasis and developmental venous anomalies are commonly confused with AVM.  Capillary telangiectasis are lesions measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter and are typically found in the pons.  The majority of the lesions do not hemorrhage and are observed as nodular enhancements after contrast on T1WI.  Developmental venous anomalies are the most common cerebral vascular malformation.  These malformations rarely hemorrhage.  If hemorrhage is noted, it is most likely due to a coexisting cavernous angioma.  If the malformation is isolated, they appear to be composed of dilated medullary veins that form a large channel draining into cortical veins or subependymal veins.  If there is high blood flow, AV fistula shares similar characteristics with AVM.  AV fistula is an arterial dissection or laceration that spontaneously communicates with an adjacent vein or dural sinus.

The patient has tenderness with activity and at rest.\n\nFINDINGS:  Plain films:  Bilateral shoulder and acromioclavicular joints are remarkable for a geographic expansile lytic lesion of the distal right clavicle, with with intact cortex, no matrix formation, and no obvious soft tissue mass.\n\nMRI: There is a destructive, lytic, expansile mass lesion of the distal right clavicle extending into the acromioclavicular joint, with associated soft tissue mass.  The expansile component is seen at its superior aspect, and the inferior distal clavicular cortex is intact.  There are multiple lobulations to this mass, with both high and low intralesional signal intensity components on the T2-weighted images, suggestive of intralesional\nnecrosis and/or hemorrhage.  Patchy enhancement is seen within the lesion and in the soft tissues surrounding it following the intravenous administration of gadolinium.  Edematous changes of the adjacent and surrounding soft tissues are present.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Giant cell tumor, Ewings Sarcoma, lymphoma,  and osteosarcoma. In an older patient metastisis and multiple myeloma should also be considered.\n\nDIAGNOSIS: Giant Cell Tumor. \n\nGiant cell tumor is a frequent benign osseous neoplasm seen in young adults; it has\na predilection for the end of the long bones, more often around the knee. In the foot and ankle region, it is seen more often in the distal tibia, talus, and calcaneus. A multicentric propensity has been seen in these locations. \n\nRadiographically, giant cell tumors are well-circumscribed, expansile, lytic, geographical lesions without rims of sclerosis, and they extend to the subchondral bone. On MRI, they demonstrate expansile contours, often with a rim of low signal intensity, which does not correlate with a rim of sclerosis on plain films.

They are rarely found in patients over 25 years of age.\n\nDisease course: The most frequent presentation is a child with an unrelated injury whose NOF is found on plain radiographs.

Rarely, an NOF presents as pathologic fracture, usually when the lesion occupies more than 50% of the bone diameter.

Most solid tumors larger than 4-5 milimeters in size grow their own blood vessels. [See Angiogenesis - http://rad.medpix.net/medpix/radpix.html?mode=single&recnum=2733 ]  The tumor has \"angiogenic\" factors that stimulate blood vessels.  Many of these same tumors also have angioinvasive factors that allow the tumor to penetrate through vessel walls.  Therefore, the tumor is richly vascularized - giving it a path to the systemic circulation; and, once the tumor \"embolizes\" the small tumor fragments are able to erode through the vessel and implant into the surrounding tissue.  Thus creating a metastatic deposit.\n\nThere is a \"cascade\" theory for tumor embolization and metastasis.  Blood from the gut is \"filtered\" in the liver, and gastrointestinal metastases usually begin in the liver before they spread to other organs.  The lung filters all of the systemic blood as it passes through, and metastatic disease here is common from all tumor sources.

If adequate trials of physical therapy fail, indicated by continued anterior instability and pain, or if multiple dislocations occur, more invasive procedures are performed.  Various surgical procedures have been developed for treatment of recurrent anterior dislocations of the humeral head.  Treatment can be either by arthroscopy or open anterior shoulder repair (axillary approach or the Bankart lesion fixation procedure); other procedures include the Bristow Helfet procedure, Magnuson Stack procedure, Eden Hybinette procedure, Oudard procedure and Trillat procedure.  The Bankart procedure is the gold standard, with success rates of 90-95%.  In associated Hill-Sachs lesions, the glenoid can be augmented with a tricortical iliac crest graft.Traditionally, arthroscopic techniques have had a failure rate of about 20% at 3.5 years, whereas the newer Bankart fixation techniques have brought this down to 10% or less.

The Hill-Sachs fracture results from this anterior dislocation (97% vs. 3%) with compression of posterolateral aspect of the humeral head by the inferior glenoid labrum. Hill-Sachs deformities occur in 35-40% of anterior dislocations and up to 80 % of recurrent dislocations. Hill-Sachs fractures can occur with subluxations, or single or multiple dislocations.  The dislocation may also cause a Bankart fracture at the impact site on the glenoid.  This is a fracture of the anterior aspect of the inferior rim of the glenoid caused by the anterior movement of the humeral head and is best seen on the anteroposterior projection with the arm in the neutral position.  If radiographs at presentation show no dislocation, the presence of either Hill-Sachs deformities or Bankart’s fractures are indicative of a prior dislocation. MRI is the best imaging modality for identifying cartilaginous and osseous Hill-Sachs deformities and associated tears of the anterior glenoid labrum.  The contour defect of both cartilage and bone at the superior aspect of the humeral head posterolaterally represents the Hill-Sachs deformity and the high signal intensity separating the cartilaginous labrum from the bony labrum represents the tear – the Bankart lesion.\nThe younger the patient when the first dislocation occurs, the greater is the probability that dislocation will recur.   Thus, patients 20 years old or younger have a 80-90% chance of lifetime recurrence, those 30 or younger have a 60% recurrence rate, and of those 40 and older at time of first dislocation, have a 10-15% probability of recurrence.", "keywords": "Hill-SachsBankartshoulder dislocation", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2043_synpic17061", "MPX2043_synpic17062", "MPX2043_synpic17064"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2043_synpic17061", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2043_synpic17061.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - PDW Proton Density", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "FSE Proton Density W/ FAT SAT.

Screening for MCA berry aneurysms.", "discussion": "With routine screening of blood pressure, hypertension has become the leading initial presenting symptom of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.", "topic_title": "Autosomal Dominant \"Adult\" Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)", "acr_code": "8.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "BACKGROUND: \nThe autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an important cause of renal failure, accounting for 10% to 15% of patients who receive hemodialysis. Its incidence is approximately 1 in 500 to 1000, and approximately 500,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease. \n\nTwo genes for ADPKD have been localized, PKD1 on chromosome 16 and PKD2 on chromosome 4. A third but rare genetic locus, PKD3, is thought to exist but has not yet been identified. The trait theoretically has a 100% penetrance, and on average, because it is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, 50% of an affected individual’s offspring will likewise be affected. Ninety-six percent of affected persons will manifest the disease clinically by age 90 years.\n\nETIOLOGY:\nOne theory suggests that a defect in the basement membrane of the tubules accounts for cyst development.  A 2nd theory holds that epithelial hyperplasia is an integral part of cyst formation. A 3rd theory postulates a defect in one of the proteins of the supportive extracellular connective tissue matrix.  A 4th theory involves the location of Na+ -K+ -ATPase in the cystic epitheliumEach theory has supportive findings.  However, it appears that tubular epithelial cell hyperplasia is the major component of cyst development.\n\nGENETICS: \nTwo genes have been identified as the culprits for ADPKD: the polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) gene localized on the short arm of chromosome 16, which accounts for approximately 85% to 90% of cases, and the PKD2 gene localized to chromosome 4, which accounts for approximately 5% to 10% of cases. The presence of a third locus (PKD3) is now accepted as the cause of disease in a very small percentage of patients.   Those with the PKD2 defect usually typically  have a later onset of clinical symptoms and a slower progression of disease. In addition, Bear, et al, suggested that the disease in general is more severe and manifests earlier when it is inherited from the mother rather than from the father.\n\nCLINICAL FEATURES:\nTypically, symptoms or signs first occur between the ages of 30 and 50 years. These include microscopic and gross hematuria, flank pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and renal colic secondary either to clots or stone and hypertension. Microscopic or gross hematuria is seen in 50% of patients, and in 19% to 35% it is the presenting symptom.  However, as blood pressure screening has become more widespread, hypertension more than hematuria has become the principal form of presentation.  In children who present after 1 year of age, the principal signs and symptoms are related to hypertension, proteinuria, and/or hematuria.  Neonates present mostly on the basis of renomegaly. When the disease is severe, stillbirth or significant respiratory distress can occur.\n\nApproximately 10% to 40% of patients have berry aneurysms, and approximately 9% of these patients die because of subarachnoid hemorrhages.\n\nOther abnormalities associated with ADPKD are mitral valve prolapse and colonic diverticulosis.\n\nHISTOPATHOLOGY:\nThe renal cysts range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter and appear diffusely throughout the cortex and medulla with communications at various points along the nephron.  Epithelial hyperplasia or even adenoma formation in the cyst wall is common, and the basement membrane of the wall is thickened. Arteriosclerosis is present in more than 70% of patients with preterminal or terminal renal failure, and interstitial fibrosis, with or without infiltrates, is common. This fibrosis may be secondary to infection or to an inflammatory reaction set off by spontaneously rupturing cysts.\n\nASSOCIATION WITH RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (RCC):\nThe incidence of RCC in patients with ADPKD is no higher than that in the general population.\n\nEVALUATION:\nTo make the diagnosis, it is important to have a history of the patient’s family spanning at least three generations.  When there is no family history to support a diagnosis of ADPKD, a presumptive diagnosis can be made if bilateral renal cysts are present and two or more of the following symptoms are present as well: bilateral renal enlargement; three or more hepatic cysts; cerebral artery aneurysm; and a solitary cyst of the arachnoid, pineal gland, pancreas, or spleen.\n\nIn adults, intravenous urography usually reveals bilateral renal enlargement, calyceal distortion, and a bubble or Swiss cheese appearance in the nephrogram phase. A CT scan or MRI may is superior to sonography for detecting cysts in organs other than the kidney. CT is helpful in making the diagnosis of hemorrhage within a cyst. More acute hemorrhage has a higher density (50 to 90 Hounsfield units [HU]) than old hemorrhage. MRI also may be helpful, particularly in patients with compromised renal function, because no contrast agent is needed\n\nEXAMINATION OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND GENETIC COUNSELING\nBecause ADPKD is an autosomal dominant condition, 50% of the children of affected adults will also be affected. Therefore, when the disease is diagnosed, the patient’s children should be examined by ultrasound. Before 1970, diagnosis of ADPKD before the age of 25 years was rare. With ultrasound, the possibility of making the diagnosis in affected individuals before this age is at least 85%. When genetic studies are used, the diagnostic accuracy approaches 100%.\n\nTREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS\nMore than 60% of patients with ADPKD who do not yet have renal impairment have hypertension, which can worsen renal function, cause cardiac disease, and predispose the patient to intracranial hemorrhage. The complications of ADPKD can be reduced significantly by controlling the blood pressure.\n\nAcute pain may be secondary to infection or hemorrhage into a cyst or to subcapsular bleeding. Chronic loin pain requiring narcotics is probably related to distention of cysts and the renal capsule. Some have proposed an operation that involves unroofing the cysts to relieve the pain. \n\nThe rate of renal deterioration seems to correlate with the rate of cyst growth.  Churchill, et al, calculated that patients with sonographically identifiable ADPKD have a 2% chance of developing end-stage renal failure by age 40 years, a 23% chance by age 50, and a 48% chance by age 73.\n\nEMERGING THERAPEUTICS:\nBecause polycystic kidney disease entities represents hyperplastic cystic conditions, Grantham suggested that it is time to treat polycystic kidney diseases like the neoplastic disorders they are. One such method would be to block the action of growth factors or their receptors. Another would be to consider chemotherapeutic agents.", "keywords": "ADPKD; autosomal; dominant; polycystic; kidney; disease;", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1996_synpic16444", "MPX1996_synpic16445", "MPX1996_synpic16446"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1996_synpic16444", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1996_synpic16444.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Multiple bilateral cysts.\nAX T1 RFF AST BH", "age": "41", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "8.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1996_synpic16445", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1996_synpic16445.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Multiple  bilateral renal cysts with T2W high signal intensity.\nAX T2 EXP BH", "age": "41", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "8.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1996_synpic16446", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1996_synpic16446.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MRA - MR Angiography/Venography", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Multiple nonenhancing bilateral renal cysts.", "age": "41", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "8.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n41 y/o black male presented to the ER with atypical chest pain.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVitals demonstrates hypertension (>190/>110) without laboratory evidence of end-organ damage (i.e., hypertensive urgency).\n\nPE is normal with non-focal neurologic exam.\nBUN - 17\nCreatinine - 1.2\n\nImaging Findings:\nMultiple, bilateral, cystic lesions are present on non-contrast MR.

Lower lumbar disk herniation is a particularly common clinical problem. Herniation is a localized displacement of disk material through a defect or tear in the annulus fibrosis. The protruding or extruded material is typically comprised of nucleus pulposus but may also include annular tissue, fragmented bone, or cartilage. Disk herniations can cause localized pain arising from nerve endings in the annular fibers at the location of the herniation. Disk herniations also commonly cause radicular symptoms due to compression of spinal nerve roots exiting the neuroforamen at the level of the herniation or by compression of nerve roots traversing the spinal canal to exit at lower levels. Myelopathic symptoms occur if the herniated disk material compresses the spinal cord sufficiently to interfere with normal cord function.\n\nThe disk space is defined cranio-caudally by the vertebral body endplates and peripherally by the outer edges of the vertebral body ring apophyses (excluding osteophytes). In the axial plane, a \"localized\" disk herniation is limited to 25% or less of the disk circumference. \"Broad based\" refers to disk herniations between 25% to 50% of the disk circcumference. \"Concentric broad based disk bulge\" refers to a concentric bulge of the disk occupying greater than 50% of the disk circumference. Herniations may be described as \"protusions\" or \"extrusions.\" Protusion implies that the widest dimension of the protruded material is less than the width of the separation in the annular fibers at the neck of the protusion. Extrusion implies that the widest dimension of extruded material exceeds the width of the annular fiber tear at the neck of the protusion. A \"sequestered disk\" is a free fragment of extruded disk material which is no longer in continuity with the disk material within the disk space. A free fragment can migrate to any location and lodge above or below the disk space and in rare instances can transgress the dura and lie intradurally. \n\nThe diagnosis of disk herniation can be made by MR or CT. On MR the presence of disk material may be seen extending beyond the confines of the disk space. The disk material may be seen circumferentially bulging or focally protruding or extruding and compressing the thecal sac or nerve roots. This can be demonstrated in the axial or sagittal planes, and, if detected, should be confirmed in the other plane.  In general, the herniated disk material should have similar intensity or density to the parent disk. On MR, this is not always the case, depending on the state of hydration of the parent disk and the fragment and the particular pulse sequence used. [1]\n\nTreatment of disk herniation depends upon the level of the herniation, the severity of the herniation, and the nature of the symptoms it produces. Treatment ranges from very conservative therapies (e.g. bedrest, NSAIDs, analgesics, physical therapy) to minimally invasive therapies (e.g. steroid/analgesic epidural injections) to fully invasive surgical procedures (e.g. laminectomy, discectomy, vertebral body fusions.) Surgical interventions are typically reserved for patients who have failed conservative treatment, who have intractable pain, or who have significant neurological symptoms resulting directly from the herniation.", "keywords": "disk herniationdisk protrusiondisk extrusion", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2514_synpic19027", "MPX2514_synpic19028"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2514_synpic19027", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2514_synpic19027.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Can you detect the abnormality?", "age": "41", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "3.9", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2514_synpic19028", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2514_synpic19028.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Can you describe the finding?", "age": "41", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "3.9", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nPatient heard his lower back \"pop\" during exercise.

This requires immediate neurosurgical consultation.  This particular patient is scheduled to undergo surgery.", "discussion": "The open skull defect with protruding mass narrows the ddx to encephalocele and meningocele.  Since both CSF and brain parenchyma are noted protruding from the skull defect, the dx is encephalocele.", "topic_title": "Fronto-nasal encephalocele", "acr_code": "1.1", "category": "Congenital, malformation", "disease_discussion": "The term cephalocele refers to a defect in the skull and dura with extracranial extension of intracranial structures.  The term encephalocele refers to herniation of both brain tissue and meninges through the skull defect, whereas the term meningocele refers to herniation of the meninges only.  Both the skull defect and herniation are more common in the midline.  \n\nMost encephaloceles are easily recognized by the clinician.  On initial examination, the patient has a large midline extracranial mass that is soft to palpation.  In patients with obvious masses such as these, the imaging study is obtained to look for associated brain anomalies that may alter the child's prognosis.  An example of such an associated anomaly is shown in Films .3 - .6.  This patient with a large frontal encephalocele also has agenesis of the corpus callosum and multiple gray matter heterotopias in the subependymal region.  The absence of the corpus callosum can be detected on both the sagittal images by the absence of the corpus on the midline image and on the axial images by the characteristic shape of the frontal horns and the parallel lateral ventricles.\n\nAnother reason to obtain imaging studies in patients with encephaloceles is to look for the location of the major vascular structures of the brain.  Particularly, because most encephaloceles are in the midline, the torcula and the superior sagittal sinus are crucial structures that must be located.  In Films .7 - .9, a parietal encephalocele is shown.  This case has two very important findings.  The first is the deformity of the brain in the region of the encephalocele.  Notice how the midbrain and cerebellum are stretched toward the calvarial defect.  This stretching results from the pulsations of the brain causing it to be pushed out of the calvarial defect.  The immature brain (before myelination) is very soft and easily deformed.  Therefore it can be molded into just about any shape.  It is common to see this sort of stretching of brain toward the skull defect in patients with encephaloceles.  The other important feature of this case is the position of the superior sagittal sinus.  On sequential coronal films, going from front to back, the sagittal sinus can be visualized in its entirety in relation to the encephalocele.  Arrows point to the sinus as it courses within the most inferior and lateral aspect of the sac on the right.  Notice that the sinus would be outside of the calvarium if the calvarium were present.  More posteriorly, the torcula is high and the straight sinuses are seen to course steeply inferiorly within the walls of the tentorium cerebellum (arrows).  The steep leaves of the tentorium probably result from the same process that causes herniation of the midbrain and cerebellum into the calvarial defect.  \n\nSpecial mention should be made of sphenoidal and fronto-nasal encephaloceles because they are often clinically occult at birth.  A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of encephalocele in adolescents and young adults who present with nasal or nasopharyngeal masses.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1171_synpic26485", "MPX1171_synpic26486", "MPX1171_synpic26487", "MPX1171_synpic26497", "MPX1171_synpic26498"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1171_synpic26485", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1171_synpic26485.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Generalized", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1 sagittal view showing enlarged posterior lateral ventricle.

The etiology of the disease is not well defined. Some investigators favor an inflammatory pathogenesis while others consider PVNS a form of benign neoplasm. Other etiologies-metabolic, traumatic, and genetic-have also been considered.  Although both polyclonal & monoclonal lineages of synovial cells have been demonstrated, current opinion favors a neoplastic process (2). \n\nA 1980 epidemiologic study of 166 patients reported the incidence of this tumor as 1.8-2 per million per year (3). There appears to be no sex predilection. The most common sites of involvement are the knee, hip, ankle, shoulder, & elbow in decreasing order of frequency (4).  \n\nWhen the knee is involved symptoms are typically non-specific with pain, effusion, & warmth being the most frequently reported. Range of motion becomes limited as the mass occupies more space. Studies are generally normal with the exception of gross blood upon aspiration of the joint space (4).\n\nMR imaging is the primary modality for evaluating PVNS. Radiographs are used in the initial evaluation and are helpful in delineating osseous erosions. Synovial chondromatosis and PVNS are the two main differentials to consider when radiographs show well mineralized bones and focal sites of erosion. Absence of calcifications and characteristic MR imaging findings, however, are more suggestive of PVNS. On MR imaging PVNS appears as an intra-articular soft tissue mass (or masses) and can exhibit variable signal intensity depending on the amount of hemosiderin deposition, lipid filled macrophages, & fibrosis (4). Villous or cystic low-signal-intensity masses combined with a “blooming” artifact on the gradient-recalled echo sequence are nearly pathognomonic for PVNS. After contrast, PVNS will enhance. In the absence of typical MR findings, CT-guided biopsy should be considered. At histology, the presence of mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells, and hemosiderin deposition are consistent with the diagnosis of PVNS (4). \n\nThe traditional treatment of PVNS is total synovectomy (5). Post-surgical adjuvant radiation, either external beam or by intra-articular injection, has shown promise in some small case series (6,7). The ultimate goal of treatment is to remove the mass and prevent recurrence while preserving maximum joint function. Severe progression of the disease can lead to joint destruction and a need for arthrodesis.", "keywords": "Pigmented villonodular synovitisPVNSBenign neoplasm", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1935_synpic34504", "MPX1935_synpic34505"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1935_synpic34504", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1935_synpic34504.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "T2 weighted with fat saturation MR images of the left knee showed multiple low-signal-intensity masses in the anterior and posterior knee and a large knee effusion.

Other reasons for this complication include hematological or systemic diseases such as polycythemia, lupus, various malignancies, severe dehydration or certain chemotheraputic agents.  Virtually anything that slows down blood flow or causes direct inflammation can cause this potentially life-threatening complication.  Fortunately, the mortality rate, which was once as high as 10-30% has now decreased to less than 10% because of improved early detection and more adequate therapy.\n\n     The clinical presentation is often vague.  A high index of clinical suspicion is often warranted if one is to make a timely diagnosis.  Early symptoms can start off with headache that then progresses to focal neurological deficits.  Reports of lethargy, confusion, nausea, drowsiness, nystagmus and hearing loss complicate the neurological exam.  A high degree of clinical suspicion is helpful if evaluating an at risk population.

They are the most common childhood tumor, occurring in 12% of children.  They are more common in females, whites, premature infants, and twins.  \n\nAt birth these lesions can be small and inconspicuous, with 60% absent at birth.  The natural history is a two stage process of proliferation and regression.  The typical hemangioma will begin to involute by 10 months of age, with half of all lesions having resolved by 5 years.\n\nClinically, hemangiomas appear as erythematous or blanching macules, or appear as a small telangiectasia.  The clinical appearance depends upon the degree of dermal involvement and lesion depth.  Lesions involving the skin have a more characteristic strawberry appearance.  Deeper lesions demonstrate a blue appearance.  \n\nMost hemangiomas are generally treated conservatively. Corticosteroids are the first line of treatment for problematic infantile capillary hemangiomas.  Other options include interferon alpha and vincristine.  Propranolol has also been observed to inhibit growth. While the mechanism of action is unclear, potential explanations include vasoconstriction; down-regulation of the RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; and the triggering of apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells. \n\nCapillary hemangiomas can develop life threatening complications, such as consumptive coagulopathy, compression of vital structures, and bleeding secondary to fissure or ulcer formation.", "topic_title": "Capillary Hemangioma", "acr_code": "2.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "Overall, hemangiomas are present in 10-12% of Caucasian children - mostly as cutaneous lesions, often called \"strawberry marks\". \n\nIntra orbital vascular lesions account for 5-20% of all orbital masses in children.  Some of these are neoplastic (capillary hemangioma) while others are malformations including venous varices and cavernous hemangioma.  Capillary hemangiomas are composed of variably sized vascular spaces that are lined by proliferating endothelial cells.  Capillary hemangiomas have been reported as the most common vascular tumor of the orbit, representing 5-12% of pediatric orbital lesions.  \n\nMultiple synonyms have been used for these lesions, including infantile hemangioma, benign hemangioendothelioma,  and hemangioblastoma.  However, these terms are neither distinctive nor accurate and the most commonly used term is “capillary hemangioma” – to allow distinction from the “cavernous hemangioma” (AKA “cavernoma”, cavernous malformation).  The cavernous hemangioma is one of the most common orbital masses in the adult patient.  The latter process is malformative and not neoplastic. [Mulliken 1982 PMID: 7063565] \n\nOrbital hemangiomas have been reported in association with PHACES (Posterior fossa malformations, Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects and coarctation of the Aorta, Eye abnormalities, and Sternal abnormalities or ventral developmental defects); and also with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. [McCannel 1996 PMID: 8643250]\n\nOrbital capillary hemangiomas (OCH) may be supplied either by branches of the internal (e.g. ophthalmic) or external carotid artery, and may extend intracranially through the superior orbital fissure or optic canal.\n\n•  Clinical\nOrbital capillary hemangioma (from now on just “hemangioma”) present as sporadic lesions in childhood, with approximately 1/3 as congenital lesions noted at birth.  The majority will present during the first decade.  Almost half of them may enlarge during a Valsalva maneuver or with crying.  There is a slight female predilection of 3:2 over males vs. up to 3:1 for cutaneous hemangioma.  These endothelial vascular neoplasms typically proliferate in the first few months after presentation; and, then most stabilize – often at an alarming size.  The natural history in most patients is for the lesions to stabilize for a period of years, and then begin spontaneous involution in adolescence, typically from 4-8 years of age.  Some cases have been followed for up to 18 years, with eventual spontaneous but slow involution. [Henderson JW Ophthalmology 1990 - PMID: 2342808]\n\nIn addition to the obvious facial discoloration and mass, capillary hemangiomas may interfere with vision, cause proptosis, diplopia or amblyopia, and even optic atrophy.  [Yap EY 1998 - PMID: 9703301]\n\n•  Gross Pathology\nThese lesions are usually ruby-red soft, rounded and occasionally lobulated masses.  Lesions with skin or subcutaneous involvement are often called “strawberry” lesions due to their red color.\n\n\n•  Histology\nThese lesions are usually well demarcated from surrounding tissues.  The histology varies with the phase of the lesion.  In younger patients, while the lesions are “active” or growing, histology shows mitotic activity from plump proliferating endothelial cells that surround small irregular vascular spaces.  Mast cells may be increased within the lesion.  Classically, involution begins within the center of the mass, and the advances outward.  Fatty and fibrous tissue surround the vascular space; and, the fibro-fatty tissue eventually replaced the vascular stroma.  These features allow distinction from cavernous hemangiomas, that have larger vascular spaces that are lined by flattened endothelial cells.\n\n\n•  Imaging\n» US\nUltrasound may play a dual role in capillary hemangioma – demonstrating the lesions as well as documenting their vascularity.  [Verity DH EYE 2006 - PMID: 17019424]  US shows great variability in lesion appearance, but can well document high-velocity flow in (100-1000 times normal) in feeding vessels.  [Verity2006]  Lesion involution is often preceded by stabilization in the rate of flow increase.  Although US can be used to follow the progression-regression sequence in these tumors, MR provides the best evaluation in the diagnostic phase. \n\n» CT\nThe appearance of orbital capillary hemangiomas varies over time.  Most commonly during the growing phase, they will appear as intensely enhancing lesions, that may be either well demarcated or poorly marginated.  Lesions may be more dense than brain (50-60 HU) due to the blood filled vascular spaces.  In the involution phase, the attenuation of the lesion will decrease, as fibro-fatty tissue replaces the vascularity.\n\n» MR\nThese lesions are usually well demarcated discrete lobulated masses with internal septations.  They are usually dark on T1W and become hyperintense with T2-weighting.  Bright contrast enhancement after Gadolinium is almost universal in these lesions.  As these lesions involute, fatty and fibrous tissue may replace the tumor and the lesion may show areas of T1 shortening.\n\n» Treatment and Prognosis\nThe majority of these lesions will undergo spontaneous regression as the child ages.  About one-half will show involution by age 5, and the overwhelming majority will show clear signs of involution by seven or eight years.  Lesions that present at younger ages may also regress earlier in the life of the child.  Both oral and parenteral steroids, interferon therapy, and surgery may be used when vision is threatened by periocular lesions.  Fractionated stereotactic radiation may have potential benefit in some cases that do not regress or are not amenable to surgery.  [Tsao MN J.

Vertebral artery dissection is commonly spontaneous or due to mild trauma such as sneezing or head turning which can stretch the artery over the lateral mass of C2.  Hyperextension may also stretch the vertebral artery at C1-2 where it exits the transverse foramen.  Conditions which predispose to arterial dissection include fibromuscular displasia, cystic medial necrosis, Marfan’s Syndrome and homocysteinuria.  \nWhile clinicians may place great emphasis on MR angiography for evaluation of the cervical arteries, standard spin-echo MRI has much greater sensitivity than MRA for dissection in the vertebral arteries (60% vs. 20%).  Findings include an enlarged vessel with associated pseudoaneurysm and an absent flow void.  Distal narrowing may be present.

Sacrococcygeal teratoma occurs in approximately 1 in 35,000 births but is reportedly the most common tumor encountered among neonates.  The prenatal diagnosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma carries a very low rate of malignancy.  However, the size and extension of the tumor is more important than the histology in prenatal studies.  It may be mainly exterior with only a minimal presacral component, predominantly external with a significant intrapelvic component, predominantly internal with intra-abdominal extension, or entirely internal with no external component.  The majority of sacrococcygeal teratomas are solid or mixed cystic and solid; only 15% are entirely cystic (as in this case).  An intra-abdominal component often displaces the urinary bladder anteriorly and may obstruct the ureters.\n\nThe differential diagnosis depends on whether the mass is predominantly solid or cystic and external or internal.  Other solid or complex masses in the sacrococcygeal region include chordoma, neurogenic tumor, lipoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, hemangioma, malignant melanoma, and meconium pseudocyst extending into the solid tissues.  A predominantly or entirely cystic mass may resemble a myelomeningocele, which must be excluded by demonstrating intact posterior spinal elements.  However, the teratoma may extend into the lumbosacral canal, and sacrococcygeal teratoma may occur with associated vertebral anomalies which make this distinction very difficult.  The differential diagnosis for an entirely intra-abdominal sacrococcygeal teratoma includes ovarian cyst, meconium pseudocyst, enteric duplication cyst, or other bowel-related abnormality.\n\nApproximately 25% of fetuses with sacrococcygeal teratoma develop hydrops, probably secondary to the vascularity of the tumor.

This technique is limited because the electrode must be positioned at least 1 cm away from major nerves.  Therefore, lesions in some locations such as the hand or vertebral column make poor candidates.", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Osteoid osteoma", "acr_code": "4.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "Osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor of the bone, which accounts for approximately 12% 2of all benign skeletal tumors.  Over 50% of the time this tumor occurs in the proximal femur and tibia with another 13% occurring in the vertebral columns, especially the posterior elements.1  Generally, these lesions occur in the intracortical and diaphyseal portions of the long bones, although they can occur in the metaphysis of the bone as well.2  The typical history associated with an osteoid osteoma is that of a person in his or her teens to twenties with nocturnal pain which responds well to aspirin.2,3  The radiologic findings of this tumor classically consist of a small (usually less than 1.5 to 2 cm) sclerotic lesion with a cortically based radiolucency (nidus).2  Surrounding the sclerosis is cortical thickening which is secondary to an extensive surrounding inflammatory response.2  While this appearance may be evident on plain film, often a CT or MRI is necessary to identify these characteristic changes, however, MRI should be used with the understanding that this method of imaging can make the appearance of an osteoid osteoma confusing.  MRI will show the sometimes extensive bone marrow reactions (which correlate with replacement of normal marrow with fibrous tissue, inflammatory cells, and hypervascularity) and soft tissue inflammation which are associated with an osteoid osteoma and the calcified nidus is often not seen with this imaging modality.  Instead, MRI can suggest that a more aggressive process is occurring, such as malignancy, infection, or fracture.2   Intra-articular osteoid osteomas create problems not seen with the typical diaphyseal lesion.  These can cause joint effusion and lymhoproliferative synovitis, and may suggest an arthritic condition.  Indeed, this may lead to osteoarthritis in up to half of these patients.2 In the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, the classic appearance on plain film or CT in addition to the classic history which appears in this case generally makes the diagnosis for the radiologist and the clinician.  However there are several important other processes which are necessary to rule out.  The most important of these processes is an osteosarcoma.  This condition typically will not have the central nidus of calcification, but more importantly it will not respect the boundaries which an osteoid osteoma respects and stay in the cortex of the bone.  While the pain may occur more strongly at night, the patient will typically not obtain strong relief from aspirin or other NSAIDs, as he or she will with an osteoid osteoma.Of the conditions which do respect the boundaries of the bone and are localized to the cortex, there are only three possibilities: osteiod osteoma, Langerhan’s cell histiocytosis, and Brodie’s abscess.2  Langerhan’s cell histiocytosis typically occurs in the skull and spine, with typical lesions being lytic with well defined margins.  Skull lesions have sharply defined punched out boarders (giving rise to “geographic skull”); spine lesions lead to variable compression of the vertebral bodies.2  Brodie’s abscess is a subacute osteomyelitis that commonly occurs as a well defined osteolytic metaphyseal lesion.  It has a sclerotic margin that fades peripherally, creating a “fuzzy” appearance.  There is no central nidus.  Occasionally Brodie’s abscess occurs as a serpiginous lucency in the metaphysis of the long bone.  These findings are often pathognomonic on plain fims.

Type II lesions demonstrate detachment of the superior labrum and biceps anchor and  may also be associated with anterior glenohumeral joint dislocation and anterior instability. SLAP types I and II may be difficult to separate on MRI, depending on the technique used for diagnosis.  Type III lesions involve a bucket-handle tear of the superior labrum (a vertical tear through a meniscoid-like superior labrum) without extension into the biceps tendon.  The biceps anchor is stable and the remaining labrum is intact. Type IV lesions also involve a bucket-handle tear associated with a meniscoid-type superior labrum, but in this case with extension into the biceps tendon. The biceps anchor and the superior labrum are well attached. A partially torn biceps tendon may displace the superior labral flap into the joint. A complex SLAP lesion may consist of a combination of two or more types, usually type II and type IV.\n\nPossible mechanisms of injury include a fall on the outstretched abducted arm with associated superior joint compression and a proximal subluxation force or a sudden contraction of the biceps tendon, which avulses the superior labrum. Repetitive stress acting through the biceps tendon or instability of the glenohumeral joint may also produce SLAP lesions. \n\nTreatment of SLAP lesions is based on the type of labral lesion present. A type I SLAP lesion is treated with arthroscopic debridement of the degenerative labrum.

Very painful hinged lesions (flap of chondral tissue) require pegs, screws, or pins for security and provide rapid pain relief.  Full-thickness lesions, where both bone and cartilage have eroded, are repaired using arthroscopic drilling, abrasion with a high-speed burr, or microfracturing using a pick.

Arachnoid cysts can be diagnosed on fetal ultrasound, and can be seen as early as during the early second trimester.  Most fetal diagnoses, however, are made later in pregnancy.\n\nArachnoid cysts usually occur from a congenital abnormality, arising from arachnoid clefts or arachnoid duplications.  They are not associated with chromosomal aneuploidy, but can be associated with brain malformations such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, absent cava, deficient cerebellar lobulation, and Arnold-Chiari type I malformation.  Acquired arachnoid cysts may develop due to CSF entrapment in arachnoid adhesions due to surgery, trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neonatal infections, or neoplasm.  They may or may not be connected to the ventricular system.  They can occur in both the cranium and the spinal canal.  They often indent a cerebral hemisphere or invaginate into fissures, however severe compression is rare.  Slow growth may occur with accumulation of fluid.\n\nArachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging.  If symptoms do occur, they may include headache, calvarial bulging, seizures, and less commonly focal neurologic signs.  Symptoms may occur due to cerebral cortical irritation, brain compression, or obstruction of CSF flow.  Diagnosis is made through imaging.\n\nDiagnostic imaging characteristics of arachnoid cysts on CT and MRI include having a smooth-surface, being non-enhancing with contrast, approximating CSF, and being homogeneous.  The consistency of the fluid in the cyst should approximate the CSF.  It should be homogeneous throughout, although simple septa within the cyst can occur.  The cysts usually occur near the cerebral fissures, with 50-60% in the middle cranial fossa.  They occur more commonly on the left side.\nSpecifically on MRI, these cysts are isointense or hypointense to brain on T1, and hyperintense to brain on T2.  MRI is superior to CT for detecting complicated cysts.\n\nFetal diagnosis of arachnoid cysts can be made by ultrasound.

Advancing age is the greatest risk factor for hip fractures; other risk factors include being Caucasian and female, having a maternal history of hip fracture, having decreased bone density, visual impairment or dementia, a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, a history of glucocorticoid, benzodiazepine or anticonvulsant use, or a history of hyperthyroidism. \n\nHip fractures often have a significant impact on the life of the person affected. Between 15-20% of elderly patients with a hip fracture die within one year of the injury. Half of the patients with a hip fractures who had previously lived independently are unable to do so following the fracture. In addition to the significant mortality, patients with hip fractures and their surgical correction are at risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, delirium, and global deterioration of functionality. \n\nPatients with hip fractures often have a history of a fall followed by pain in the hip, groin, buttocks or back. They may have difficulty walking or bearing weight after the fall. On physical exam, there may be shortening and external rotation of the affected lower extremity. A history of trauma is not necessary, however, and patients with risk factors who present with hip pain or difficulty bearing weight should be evaluated thoroughly for an occult hip fracture and for osteoporosis that is often found in the elderly age group.\n\nTo evaluate for possible femoral fractures, radiographs should be done first. However, in patients with negative radiographs but a high clinical suspicion for fracture, MR imaging is the best imaging test to diagnose a fracture missed on plain radiographs. Early diagnosis is important in order that the hip fractures can be surgically corrected, preferably within 2-3 days of injury in order to reduce hospitalization and morbidity. \n\nIngari et al showed that low-signal-intensity on T1-weighted MR images were correlative with non-displaced fractures induced in cadavers. In contrast, the high-signal-intensity that is seen on the T2-weighted MR image may represent the fracture and secondary post-traumatic edema and inflammation and may appear more extensive than the actual fracture. MR should therefore be acquired without delay if plain radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high.\n\nIf MR imaging is not available, bone scans of the hip can be useful for identifying proximal femoral fractures. However, bone scans demonstrate fracture because of the increased metabolic activity surrounding the injury; in the elderly, the bone scans may not be positive until 3 days after injury. This delay can have a negative impact on the patient’s ultimate recovery. Therefore if MR imaging is available, it is the imaging test of choice in the patient with suspected hip fracture but with negative radiographs.\n\nHip fractures in the elderly have a significant rate of morbidity and mortality. Fractures of the femoral neck can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to disrupted blood supply from the lateral circumflex femoral artery. Fractures can also lead to malunion or nonunion between fragments as well as degenerative changes in the hip joint. Also, as mentioned previously, people who suffer a hip fracture are at significant risk for developing deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, delirium, infections, and decreased conditioning and functionality. Extended periods of hospitalization and limited mobility combine to create a major obstacle to the elderly person who may never be able to recover fully.\n\nPreventive measures are important in preventing hip fractures in the elderly. The USPSTF recommends routine bone mineral density screening for women after age 65 years, and after age 60 years in high risk women. Treatment of those with decreased bone density with bisphosphonates has been shown to reduce fracture risk. High-dose oral vitamin D supplementation has also been shown to reduce the risk of fractures. Modifiable lifestyle factors include smoking cessation and weight-bearing exercise. \n\nIn patients with hip fractures, early diagnosis and surgical fixation have been shown to reduce hospitalization and adverse events. Aggressive physical therapy is also very important in returning a patient to a functional level as close to baseline as possible. Plain radiographs are the first diagnostic imaging study for evaluating for hip fracture. However, if these are negative but clinical suspicion remains high for a fracture, MR imaging should be done for definitive diagnosis. \n\nReferences:\n\nBeaupre L, Jones A, Saunders D, Johnston W, Buckingham J, Majumdar S.

The damaged structures may include the vestibular nuclei (nystagmus, oscillopsia, vertigo, nausea, vomiting); spinothalamic tract (contralateral impairment of pain and thermal sense over half the body); descending sympathetic fibers (ipsilateral Horner syndrome – miosis, ptosis, decreased sweating); fibers of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves (hoarseness, dysphagia, ipsilateral paralysis of the palate and vocal cord, diminished gag reflex); otolithic nucleus (vertical diplopia and illusion of tilting of vision); spinal trigeminal tract (pain, burning, and impaired sensation over ipsilateral half of face); nucleus and tractus solitarus (loss of taste); olivocerebellar or spinocerebellar fibers, restiform body and inferior cerebullum (ipsilateral ataxia of limbs, falling or toppling to the ipsilateral side).  This syndrome is almost always secondary to infarction, with only a small portion being the result of hemorrhage or tumor.  Most patients recover well, although reports of sudden and unexpected death may occur from respiratory or cardiac arrest in the absence of cerebellar swelling or basilar artery thrombosis.\n\nIt is interesting to note, there was no restricted diffusion indicating this was not an acute event.  Burdette et al. report that infarctions greater than two weeks old, will demonstrate no signal abnormalities on diffusion-weighted imaging. Additionally, contrast enhancement in subacute strokes with iodinated contrast agents is well understood, and is secondary to extravasation of contrast material through a leaky blood-brain barrier.  Likewise, similar findings were documented in this case with enhancement of the lateral medulla following the administration of gadolinium DTPA, consistent with a subacute infarct.\n\nReferences:\nAdams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology.  7th Edition.

The most common type is the subintimal dissection, although subadventitial dissections (clot extension in the plane between the media and adventitia) also occur. \n\nTwo theories exist with regard to the etiology of dissections, each of which invokes intimal injury as a final common pathway: \n1). An intimal tear occurs, allowing clot propagation within the vessel wall. \n2). A primary intramural hematoma develops and eventually ruptures through the intimal lining into the vessel lumen. \n\nTraumatic dissections result from three basic mechanisms of injury: \n\n1). Penetrating injuries, which include gunshot wounds, knife wounds, intra-oral trauma (pencils, sticks). With regard to characterizing the location of penetrating injuries, the neck is divided into three anatomic zones: \n*Zone 1: below the level of the cricoid cartilage. \n*Zone 2: between the level of the cricoid and the level of the mandibular angle. \n*Zone 3: superior to the level of the mandibular angle. \n\n2). Nonpenetrating injury due to spine fracture-subluxation injuries. \n\n3). Blunt injury to the carotid arteries. \n\nVertebral artery dissections account for approximately 20% of cases of cervical vascular injuries and most commonly occur between the skull base and the upper cervical spine. Less commonly, the injury occurs between the vessel’s origin from the subclavian artery and the C6 foramen transversarium. Mid-cervical vertebral artery injuries occur in approximately 5% of patient with fractures involving the foramina transversaria. \n\nInternal carotid artery dissections are the most common of all craniocervical dissections, frequently (70% of cases) involve both the cervical and petrous segments of the ICA, and usually spare the carotid bulb. Dissections involving the intracranial internal carotid artery segments, while rare, do occur. \n\nThe radiographic appearance of the contrast-opacified vertebral artery on the lateral view is as follows: the vertebral artery takes a nearly vertical course as it traverses the C6 through C3 foramina transversaria. Immediately after passing through the vertebral canal of C2, the vessel forms an inverted L and turns laterally within C2. It then exits C2 and turns cephalad to pass through the vertebral canal of C1. On exiting the transverse foramen of the atlas, it then courses sharply posteriorly along the posterior ring of C1, completing the appearance of a half square. Finally, it turns anterosuperiorly (a hairpin turn) to pierce the dura as it passes through the foramen magnum.", "keywords": "vertebral arterydissectionpontine infarct", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2563_synpic41792", "MPX2563_synpic41793", "MPX2563_synpic41794", "MPX2563_synpic41795", "MPX2563_synpic41796", "MPX2563_synpic41797", "MPX2563_synpic41798", "MPX2563_synpic41799", "MPX2563_synpic41800", "MPX2563_synpic41801", "MPX2563_synpic41802", "MPX2563_synpic41803", "MPX2563_synpic41804", "MPX2563_synpic41807", "MPX2563_synpic41808", "MPX2563_synpic41809", "MPX2563_synpic41810", "MPX2563_synpic41811", "MPX2563_synpic41814", "MPX2563_synpic41815", "MPX2563_synpic41816", "MPX2563_synpic41817"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41792", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41792.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted sagittal image of the left vertebral artery reveal a normal T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41793", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41793.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted sagittal images of the right vertebral artery reveal a diminished T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41794", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41794.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted sagittal image of the left vertebral artery reveals normal T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41795", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41795.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - FIESTA", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "FIESTA 3D sagittal image of the right vertebral artery reveals loss of the normal T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41796", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41796.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - FIESTA", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "FIESTA 3D sagittal image of the left vertebral artery in the paramedullary cistern reveals a normal T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41797", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41797.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - FIESTA", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "FIESTA 3D sagittal image of the right vertebral artery in the right paramedullary cistern reveals loss of the normal T2 signal related flow void, and a small amount of increased signal in the expected distribution of the right vertebral artery.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41798", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41798.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted axial image at the level of C2 reveals abnormal increased T2 signal involving the right vertebral artery, consistent with intramural hematoma.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41799", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41799.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted axial image at the level of the occiptal condyles reveal loss of the normal T2 signal related flow void of the right vertebral artery in the paramedullary cistern.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41800", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41800.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted axial image at the level of the medulla oblongata reveals abnormal increased signal intensity in the right vertebral artery in the paramedullary cistern.

In medical terminology, coarctation refers to a localized narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow.   Coarctation of the aorta typically occurs in the \"juxta-ductal\" part of the aorta, or the part near where the ductus arteriosus attaches near the aortic isthmus. Depending on the exact location of the constriction of the aorta, it can be classified as either preductal / isthmic (infantile) coarctation or postductal / juxtaductal (adult type) coarctation. The most frequently encountered type is the postductal / juxtaductal variety.  In the postductal type, the area of the coarctation is located at, or just distal to, the level of the left subclavian artery and ductus arteriosus and usually is short and discrete. In the rarer second type, (preductal, isthmic, or infantile) the area of narrowing usually lies proximal to the ductus arteriosus, somewhere between the left subclavian artery and the left carotid artery. Preductal coarctation is associated with an increased incidence of cardiac defects, and as preductal coarctations do not significantly alter normal fetal blood flow patterns, no collaterals form in utero hence they are typically not seen later in life. Several surgical methods of repair are employed, including end-to-end reanastomosis, subclavian flap aortoplasty, prosthetic patch onlay grafts, and interposition grafts.    Usually, the presence of coarctation alone is indication for an operation. Several techniques are currently used to repair coarctation of the aorta and the method of repair employed is usually tailored specifically to each patient.  Follow-up for these patients depends upon the clinical response to the intervention. The most common complications after coarctation repair are late restenosis and aneurysm formation at the repair site. One of the most common methods of repair of coarctation of the aorta is resection of the involved segment with end-to-end reanastomosis.  Some of the benefits of this particular technique include avoidance of prosthetic materials, excision of ductal tissue, preservation of the left subclavian artery, and relief of left ventricular outflow obstruction.  The current trend in management is to attempt a corrective surgery in neonates and to try transcatheter balloon dilation before surgery in older children and adults. Recently, treatment of aortic coarctation by percutatious catheter interventions has become more widespread, using both balloon dilation and primary stent implantation techniques. These techniques were first regarded mainly as a procedure for the treatment of recurrent coarctation. However, they have gained more widespread acceptance as a procedure for both the unoperated lesions and the recurrent coarctation / restenosis at the site of the procedure. Restenosis is a common complication and is often associated with post stenotic aneurismal dilatation. Follow-up imaging to assess for post surgical success and assessment of potential late complications can be accomplished using various modalities.  Adequate visualization of the entire arch is needed.  Angiography remain the gold standard, however noninvasive imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is becoming more popular.", "keywords": "coarctation", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1677_synpic21841", "MPX1677_synpic21842", "MPX1677_synpic21843", "MPX1677_synpic21844", "MPX1677_synpic21845", "MPX1677_synpic21866", "MPX1677_synpic22032"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1677_synpic21841", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1677_synpic21841.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MRA - MR Angiography/Venography", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Just proximal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery is a significant web across the lumen of the aortic.

Class I is partial or complete absence of the uterus and/or cervix.  Class II is a unicornuate uterus which results from agenesis of one of the mullerian ducts.  This is associated with the absence of the ipsilateral kidney.  Class III is a fusion anomaly in which there us 2 separate uterus horns, cervices, and vaginas.  Bicornuate uterus (class IV) is characterized by 2 uterine horns but one cervix and vagina.  It is caused by incomplete resorption of the uterine septum.  However, the septum is composed of myometrium and often doesn't extend the entire length of the uterine cavity.  These features distinguish it from a septate uterus in which there is a fibrous septum. These patients are typically asymptomatic and no treatment is typically necessary.  Most of these women maintain their fertility.  However, there is an association between bicornuate uterus and incompetent cervix.

When ectopic, the cerebellar tonsils may be elongated and take on a pointed appearance inferiorly discribed as \"peg-like\".  When there is extension of the tonsils greater than 12mm below the foramen magnum, symptoms are generally associated.  While other brain anomalies are not usually associated with Chiari I malformations, a variety of spine and skull base abnormalities may be seen, including Klippel-Feil, C2-3 fusions, Basilar invagination and atlantooccipital assimilation. These associated skull base and spine abnormalites are present in approximately one-quarter of patients with Chiari I malformations. Also associated is the development of syringohydromyelia (or syrinx) which is present in approximately 30% of asymptomatic and 60-90% of symptomatic patients.  While the syrinx usually occurs in the cerical spinal cord but can involve the entire length of the spinal cord or rarely occur as an isolated finding in the thoracic cord.  The syrinx represents either a dilation of the central canal of the spinal cord (hydromyelia) or extension of the fluid through the ependyma of the central canal into the adjacent cord parenchyma (syringomyelia).  The two are combined into a single term for MR purposes as they can not be distinguished from each other on imaging studies.  The formation of the syrinx is theorize to occur as a result of altered fluid flow from the central canal at the obex secondary to compression of the brainstem in the foramen magnum region by the ectopic cerebellar tonsils.

It is a benign bone lesion, seen most commonly in the second and third decades, with a male to female predilection of approximately 2 to 1(3,4).  Of all the chondromas, periosteal chondroma accounts for less than 2% of cases(5).  The most common locations for this lesion are the metaphysis or diaphysis of the proximal humerus and distal femur(2-4).\nPeriosteal chondroma presents as a well demarcated, ossific mass in a juxtacortical position, with or without sclerotic borders and not continuous with the medullary cavity(2,4).  Periosteal chondroma exhibits a characteristic saucerization of the underlying cortex(3).  T1 weighted MRI imaging typically reveals a hypointense signal, and T2 weighted imaging shows a hyperintense signal.  In addition, MR imaging reveals that this lesion does not show soft tissue involvement or continuity with the medullary cavity(6).  \nHistologically, periosteal chondroma appears as a lobulated fibrocartilaginous matrix on low power.  Higher power reveals lobules of chondrocytes, sometimes showing atypia such as binucleation (2,4,7).

The Salter Harris radiologic classification system of physeal fractures is the most commonly utilized method of describing these fractures.  This system divides fractures into five types depending upon the involvement of the physis, epiphysis, or metaphysis.\n\nType I fractures are transverse through the hypertrophic zone of the physis and results in widening of the physis.  In these injuries, the growing zone of the physis is typically not disturbed and overall growth disturbance is uncommon.\n\nType II fractures traverse the metaphysis and physis, but do not involve the epiphysis.  This represents the most common type of physeal fracture, accounting for up to 75% of injuries.  While these may result in mild limb foreshortening, functional limitations are rare.\n\nType III fractures traverse the physis and the epiphysis, but spare the metaphysis.  These represent a more serious clinical issue, as they tend to involve the articular cartilage and have a greater predisposition for growth arrest.\n\nType IV fractures involve the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis.  Like the type III injury, these fractures have a greater predisposition for growth arrest.\n\nType V fractures result from a crush injury to all or part of the physis.  Initial diagnosis may be dificult radiographically without specific clinical data.  Often the diagnosis is made in follow up, after partial or complete boney fusion across the physeal plate has ensued.\n\nWhile it has been estimated that nearly 30% of these fractures result in growth plate disturbance, only 2% result in significant functional disability.", "keywords": "Salter-HarrisPediatric traumaepiphysis", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1537_synpic39394", "MPX1537_synpic39395", "MPX1537_synpic39396"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1537_synpic39394", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1537_synpic39394.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Sagital and coronal T2 fat suppressed images demonstrate diffuse high T2 signal in the bone marrow consistent with edema in the distal femoral metaphysis and proximal tibial plateau.

The lesions are surrounded by a well defined sclerotic border with benign-appearing periosteal reaction and mild soft tissue swelling medially. The metaphyseal lesions extend across the physis into the epiphysis. There are no fracture lucencies and the joint spaces are maintained.

This rare lesion, known today as a Brodie’s abscess, is a localized type of subacute or chronic pyogenic osteomyelitis. Pathogenesis is due to an insidious bacteremia with septic emboli to a normal or minimally traumatized long bone, often from an infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The lesion is predominant in young males with unfused epiphyseal plates, typically presenting during the second decade of life. Brodie’s abscess is described as a small, eccentric, localized, lytic lesion with surrounding reactive sclerosis. It is characteristically found in the metaphyseal region of long bones of the lower extremity, most commonly in the tibia. The usual presenting complaint is recurrent pain and localized swelling; systemic symptoms are typically absent.\n\nRadiographs of a Brodie’s abscess often demonstrate a localized area of radiolucency with surrounding sclerosis. The lucent region is commonly located in the metaphysis where it may extend to the growth plate by a tortuous channel.  Detection of this focal metaphyseal abscess with involvement of the growth plate is diagnostic for osteomyelitis. Conventional radiographs should be the initial imaging study for evaluating osteomyelitis although, in early osteomyelitis they are usually normal or may show soft tissue swelling or benign periosteal reaction.\n\nBone scans are more sensitive than conventional x-rays for the early detection of osteomyelitis although not as sensitive as MR imaging.  A focal area of radiopharmaceutical uptake at the site of suspected infection would suggest a Brodie’s abscess. Both Brodie’s abscesses and eosinophilic granulomas show radiopharmaceutical uptake and therefore this cannot be used as a distinguishing feature.\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides a greater accuracy in delineating the extent of disease, a more rapid evaluation. Furthermore, MR imaging possesses a high sensitivity in the detection of bone infection. On T1-weighted MR images, subacute osteomyelitis with Brodie’s abscess presents as a low-intensity signal mass with low-signal-intensity rim that becomes a high-intensity signal mass with a thick, low-intensity rim on T2 weighted MR images. The abscess may rarely extend into the cortex and into soft tissues. In addition, the infection may rarely traverse the open growth plate, to involve the epiphysis. Other findings of chronic osteomyelitis include cortical bone thickening, sequestra, sinus tracts to the adjacent soft tissues.

Alternate diagnoses in the differential can be excluded by the absence of a lesion 15 months prior to detection in this skeletally immature youth. Histopathologic confirmation with and positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, however, provide definitive diagnosis of a Brodie’s abscess.\n\nTreatment for Brodie’s abscess includes surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy. A sterile abscess may be treated without antibiotics only if there is symptomatic improvement and radiographic regression of the lesion. More aggressive treatment, such debridement followed by bone grafting, may be needed for abscesses that form slightly before or after bone maturation and do not resolve with surgical treatment.", "topic_title": "Multi organism osteomyelitis", "acr_code": "4.2", "category": "Unsure", "disease_discussion": "Osteomyelitis may result from open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue, from hematogenous and local spread from adjacent tissues and as a postoperative complication(1). The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i. e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. \n\nTreatment generally involves clinical evaluation, imaging evaluation for disease extent, laboratory determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.  Localized bone pain, erythema and drainage around the affected area may be present. The cardinal signs of subacute and chronic osteomyelitis include draining sinus tracts, deformity, instability and local signs of impaired vascularity, range of motion and neurologic status. \n\nWhen there is clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis after physical examination and history, baseline radiographs should be performed followed by magnetic resonance imaging when available to define the extent of osteomyelitis and cellulitis. When MRI is not available, bone scans are useful for determining the extent of the infection. Laboratory tests may show leukocytosis (especially in the acute presentation) and elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level may be noted. Blood cultures are positive in as high as one-half of children with acute osteomyelitis. \n\nIn acute osteomyelitis, the radiographs may be negative or may show only soft tissue swelling and periosteal reaction. Evidence of medullary destruction may not appear until approximately two weeks after the onset of infection. Positive radiographic findings, when present include osteolysis, periosteal reaction and sequestra (segments of necrotic bone separated from living bone by granulation tissue). \n\nA bone abscess found during the subacute or chronic stage of hematogenous osteomyelitis is known as a Brodie's abscess.

Some sources state that they account for as little as 0.3% to as much as 1.8% of tumors.  During the third and fifth week of fetal development during the closure of the neural tube, epidermoids derive from the ectopic inclusions of epithelial cells.  If the cells have less cell differentiation, they result in dermoid tumors instead of epidermoid tumors.  The epithelial lesions grow at a rate similar to skin cells, and as a result, cause a very slow symptomatic onset.  \n\nThey usually arise in the suprasellar region, the skull base, brainstem, or cerebellopontine angle.  Recent literature suggests that epidermoid tumors have mostly been found at the cerebellopontine angle (37.3%) and in the parasellar region (30%), growing by spreading in the subarachnoid space of the basal cisterns.  They rarely develop into malignant processes.\n\nEpidermoids have a pearly appearance and are well circumscribed and encapsulated.  The epidermoids that are hypodense on CT may contain a soft, waxy material that consists of cholesterol crystals.  The hyperintense epidermoids on the other hand are mostly cystic and contain fluid of various colors.  Other sources suggest that the inner material is due to the progressive desquamation and breakdown of keratin.\n\nSymptoms associated with epidermoids usually appear after the second decade of life.  These symptoms are caused by displacement of adjacent vascular and neural structures.  The most frequent presenting symptom is trigeminal neuralgia.  Other symptoms that can occur are similar to those caused by acoustic neuroma like vertigo, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral tinnitus.  If the lesion gets very large, symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, and ataxia, or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus can develop.      \n\nOn imaging, most epidermoid tumors show a distinctive MRI appearance.  They are usually hypointense on T1 MRI and hyperintense on T2 MRI.  On T1, they can also show a characteristically marbled inner pattern.  Diffussion-weighted imaging can provide additional information by showing a clear, hyperintense signal.

Due to the invasive nature of high-grade astrocytomas, complete surgical resection is not possible.  Therefore, surgery is only indicated to obtain tissue for pathologic diagnosis and control mass effects.  In patients younger than 65, the extent of tumor resection correlates with survival, so accessible tumors are resected aggressively in this population if the patient is otherwise healthy.  Following surgery, radiation therapy is administered.  Focal radiation has been shown to be as effective and less toxic in this patient population, and is administered to the tumor mass, plus a 3-4-cm margin.  A total dose of 5000 to 7000 cGy is administered in 25-35 equal fractions, 5 days per week.  Finally, chemotherapy is initiated.

They usually lie in the sacrococcygeal area (50%) or the clivus (35%).  These tumors most often affect patients greater than 30 years of age.\n\nClival chordomas comprise less that 2% of intracranial tumors. They typically arise within the bone and are therefore extradural.  They also invade the surrounding bone and may extend to compress adjacent structures such as cranial nerves and the brain stem.\n\nClival chordomas are usually of a gelatinous consistency and may have secondary hemorrhage and necrosis. These changes can be present throughout the tumor.  \n\nMicroscopically, physaliphorus cells are seen, that contain large cytoplasmic vacuoles rich in glycogen and mucin.  These are separated into nests by fibrous sheets.  \n\nImmunohistochemistry reveals positive staining for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen.  Chondroid chordomas, a more benign subtype, typically contains hyaline cartilage.\n\nBoth CT and MR are used to diagnose and delineate the extent of clival chordomas.  On CT, adjacent bone destruction is seen, and areas of low attenuation in the mass may represent the gelatinous matrix.  Calcification is occasionally seen inside the mass.\n\nOn MR, high signal intensity is seen on T2-weighted images.  These tumors are usually iso or hypo-intense on T1-weighted imaging with areas of occasional high signal intensity, representing blood or mucin.\n\nAfter administration of gadolinium contrast, these tumors typically demonstrate heterogenous enhancement, and typically have a “honeycomb” appearance, due their lobular organization.\n\nMR also is useful to characterize possible internal carotid or vertebrobasilar encasement.\n\nTreatment for clival chordomas usually consists of a dual approach: surgical removal and radiation.  Depending upon direction of growth of the chordoma, a transphenoidal, transmaxillary, transbasal, cranioorbitozygomatic, or transcondylar approach may be used.  Occasionally, subtotal resection of the mass is performed, due to high risk of injury to adjacent neurovascular structures.  Potential complications include stroke, cranial nerve palsy, CSF leak, and meningitis.\n\nProton beam therapy has been the mainstay of radiation treatment for clival chordomas.  Any form of radiation is given postoperatively, and in most cases, traditional forms of treatment are avoided to limit the amount of injury to vital surrounding structures.  A study performed by Pearlman and Friedman showed an 80% local control rate with a minimum of 80 Gy and only 20% control rate with 40 to 60 Gy.\n\nAlthough histologically benign, clival chordomas have a high rate of recurrence, which may be related to sub-total resection.  Distant metastases are uncommon.  Survival rate approaches 50% at five years and 30% at ten years.  Greater extent of resection is correlated with improved survival.", "keywords": "chordomaclivusskull base", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1502_synpic40651", "MPX1502_synpic40652", "MPX1502_synpic40653", "MPX1502_synpic40654", "MPX1502_synpic40655", "MPX1502_synpic40656"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1502_synpic40651", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1502_synpic40651.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Multiple representative MR images are demonstrated.

They arise from ependymal cells lining the central canal or its remnants and from the cells in the filum terminale.  Of these tumors, there are two subsets: intramedullary ependymomas (cellular ependymomas), and ependymomas occurring nearly exclusively in the conus medullaris and filum terminale (myxopapillary ependymomas).  \nMyxopapillary ependymomas represent 10-15% of all ependymomas, and account for 90% of the primary tumors in the filum terminale and cauda equina.  These tumors are fleshy, sausage-shaped, reddish to purple in color and moderately vascular on gross examination.  Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to grow slowly and to large sizes (often spanning 2-4 vertebral segments), often expanding adjacent bone of the lumbosacral canal and neural foramina.  They commonly hemorrhage which can lead to nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and superficial siderosis, as well as complex internal signal characteristics and calcification.  \nComputed tomography of myxopapillary ependymomas typically demonstrates an isodense intradural mass, with possible bony expansion, and strong, uniform contrast enhancement.  Magnetic resonance imaging of these tumors demonstrates an intradural mass that is typically isointense to the spinal cord on T1-weighted images, hyperintense to the spinal cord on T2-weighted sequences, and demonstrated strong homogenous enhancement following contrast administration.  Myxopapillary ependymomas with a hemorrhagic component may demonstrate heterogeneity on T1-weighted sequences, and a low signal-intensity hemosiderin rim on T2-weighted sequences.\nClinically myxopapillary ependymomas most often present with low back, leg or sacral pain.  Leg weakness and sphincter dysfunction are only seen in 20-25% of patients.  Due to their indolent growth, delay in diagnosis is common with these tumors, with an average of 2.4 years of symptoms before a correct diagnosis is established.  Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to occur in males more often than females (2:1), with a peak age of diagnosis within the 3rd to 4th decades of life.   Complete surgical resection is generally curative, although local recurrence is possible if resection is incomplete.  Adjuvant radiation therapy is used for multifocal lesions.  Certain aggressive sacral and presacral tumors may spread locally to lymph nodes and rarely to distant sites (e.g. lungs and bone).", "keywords": "EpendymomaFilum terminale massAstorcytoma", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2139_synpic29035", "MPX2139_synpic29036", "MPX2139_synpic29037", "MPX2139_synpic29038"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2139_synpic29035", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2139_synpic29035.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W w/Gadolinium", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "In the spinal canal, from approximately the mid body of T11 through the sacrum, is a large expansile intradural mass which is isointense to the cord on T1, hyperintense to the cord on T2 and avidly enhances with gadolinium albeit heterogeneous.
