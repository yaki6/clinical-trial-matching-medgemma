In utero, the ductus arteriosus (DA) serves as a shunt between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, allowing fetal blood to bypass the high-pressure vascular system of the lungs, which are filled with fluid and not serving to oxygenate blood. \nShortly after birth, the lungs fill with air and the pressure within the pulmonary vasculature drops, reversing the shunt through the DA. The DA begins to close at this time, and eventually fibroses and becomes the ligamentum arteriosum, and there is no more shunt. \nIn some people, the DA does not close, so that a left-to-right shunt persists from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. The diameter and length of the PDA, and thus the amount of arterial blood being shunted to the lungs, determines whether or not the PDA causes symptoms or eventual complications.  In general, there are three categories (small, moderate, large) based on the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of blood through the PDA.\nA small PDA may never be detected, because the amount of higher-pressure arterial blood being shunted to the pulmonary artery is not enough to cause pulmonary hypertension or exercise intolerance, as may be seen in larger shunts. The astute clinician may detect a continuous flow murmur during cardiac auscultation, but this is not always present. \nA moderate size PDA may cause exercise intolerance when lower extremity demand for oxygen is not met by left ventricular output, because some of the blood is being shunted back into the pulmonary circulation before it circulates systemically. The upper extremities may not be affected to the same degree, because the DA arises distal to the Left Subclavian Artery, and thus the upper extremities receive blood before it is shunted back into the pulmonary system. Also, as a result of this shunting, the left heart receives a larger volume of blood and, over time, this can result in left ventricular dilation and eventual dysfunction. These patients will likely have an audible flow murmur. \nA large PDA causes a significant shunt and overloading of the left ventricle because it must pump a larger amount of blood. This can result in dilation and LV failure. In addition, the higher systemic blood pressure is transmitted through the PDA to the normally-low pressure pulmonary vascular bed. Over time, this will result in pulmonary hypertension, which may become severe enough to overcome the systemic pressure and result in a reversal of the shunt (Eisenmenger Syndrome).  Now deoxygenated blood passes from the pulmonary artery through the PDA into the systemic circulation and mixes with arterial blood.

Possible causations include persistent microtrauma (or one incident of significant magnitude), ischemia, genetic and endocrine factors, and anomalies of ossification.  The leading theory suggests that after repetitive microtrauma to the subchondral bone, focal areas of ischemia and/or alterations in bone growth causes the bone to break down.  The overlying articular cartilage may weaken and either cave in forming an empty cavity or tear apart leading to a detached or nearly detached articular fragment within the joint space.  Two types of OCD, juvenile and adult, are based primarily on growth potential of the bone.  Juvenile OCD (5-15 years old at presentation) typically has a better healing potential and better prognosis; detachment of cartilage is rare in children.  Adult OCD (16-50 years old at presentation) has a much higher risk for developing moderate to severe osteoarthritis later in life on the affected joint.  The knee (usually the medial femoral condyle) is most affected comprising as high as 85% of all lesions.  Other affected joints include the talus, capitellum, and wrist.  Males are affected more than females, 3 to 1.  Typically patients complain of a gradually increasing pain associated with activity.  They may also complain that the knee swells, “gives out,” or locks.  Physical exam may reveal poorly localized tenderness on the affected side along with crepitus and/or an effusion.  In one-third of cases, the knees present bilaterally; therefore, the opposite knee should also be viewed on radiograph.  Radiographic findings are as described above; however, three views (frontal, lateral, and tunnel) are usually required to identify all possible lesions.  MRI is necessary not for diagnostic purposes, but to evaluate the cartilage overlying the lesion.

HSV-1 accounts for 95% of all herpetic encephalitis, and is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. \n\nThe presenting symptoms are multiple and often originate with fever, headache, seizures, confusion, stupor, and coma.  Patients may also demonstrate the gradual onset of olfactory hallucinations, anosmia, personality change, psychotic behavior, delirium, aphasia, and hemiparesis.   These symptoms are directly related to the involvement of the temporal lobes, insular cortex, and orbital surface of the frontal lobes by this disease.\n\nAfter initial contact through infected secretions in the oronasopharnyx, HSV-1 travels via the lingual portion of the trigeminal nerve, to the gasserian ganglia where the virus remains dormant.  Upon reactivation from the influences of local trauma, immunosuppression, or stress, or the result of primary infection, the virus spreads in a retrograde fashion along the fibers that innervate the leptomeninges of the anterior and middle fossa.\n\nEarly diagnosis and rapid therapy is essential, as herpes encephalitis progresses rapidly.  The mortality rate ranges from 50% to 70%, with those surviving left with significant neurological impairment to include amnesia, dementia, seizures, and aphasia.  Both the patient’s age and level of consciousness at the time of initiation of intravenous acyclovir dictate outcomes.  If the patient is unconscious prior to beginning therapy, the outcome is poor.  If the patient is awake, and treatment is begun within 4 days of onset of the illness, survival is greater than 90 percent. \n\nLaboratory:\n\nCSF demonstrates increased pressure and a pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance.  \nRed cells, and xanthochromia are identified in a minority of cases, secondary to hemorrhage.  Protein content is increased, and CSF glucose may rarely be lower than 40 mg/dL.\n\nPolymerase Chain Reaction may be employed to identify HSV antigen in the CSF while the virus is replicating in the first few days of the illness.\n\nPathology:\n\nGross Pathologic Features: \n\nHemorrhagic and necrotizing encephalitis of gray and white matter, with severe edema and tissue necrosis localized to the inferior frontal, temporal lobes, and insular cortex.  \n\nMicroscopically:\n\nFocal necrotizing vasculitis with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, with eosinophilic Cowdry intranuclear inclusion bodies located in neurons, and glial cells.\n\nHerpes viruses include HSV-1, HSV-2, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, B virus, HSV-6, and HSV-7.\n\n\nRadiology:\n\nThe imaging findings of HSV encephalitis on CT may be initially normal or subtly abnormal.  Generally, abnormalities are not identified until 3-5 days after the onset of significant symptoms.  Common initial findings are low attenuation in the medial temporal lobes and insula, with mild mass effect.  Hemorrhage may occasionally be identified and is a late finding that is highly suggestive of herpes encephalitis.  On contrast enhanced CT, there is ill-defined patchy enhancement, with gyriform enhancement being a late finding.  \n\nMRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting early changes, and demonstrates signal changes in almost all sequences.  T1 weighted images demonstrate areas of low signal intensity with surrounding edema localized to the temporal lobes, insular cortex, subfrontal area, and cingulate gyri.  Loss of the gray-white matter differentiation, and evidence of mass effect is frequently encountered.  Additionally, in cases of hemorrhage, there may be foci of increased signal in the inferior parts of the frontal and temporal lobes.  T2 weighted images demonstrate asymmetric bilateral high signal intensity in gray, and subcortical white matter of the temporal lobes, extending into the insular cortex, secondary to edema.  The basal ganglia are usually spared.  Findings are initially unilateral, followed by less severe contralateral temporal lobe signal abnormalities.\n\nProton density sequences demonstrate increased signal intensity in affected areas.  T2 weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences demonstrate hyperintense signal with edematous cortex and subcortical white matter.  T2 gradient recalled echo sequences show hypointensity if there is hemorrhage within the edematous brain parenchyma.  \n\nDiffusion weighted images demonstrate marked hyperintense restricted diffusion, and reduced ADC values.  It is important to distinguish these findings from ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, abscess, lymphoma, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, glioma, and metastatic disease, for the determination of appropriate treatment.  HSV encephalitis can be differentiated from other high signal intensity DW MR images, and low ADC values based on the clinical presentation of the patient, distribution of the imaging findings, and results of the polymerase chain reaction test.\n\nT1 weighted gadolinium enhanced images demonstrate asymmetric mild patchy enhancement indicating abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier.  Gyriform enhancement may be seen one week after initial symptoms.  Meningeal enhancement is an early finding, with parenchymal enhancement being a late finding, or evidence of hemorrhage.\n\nMR spectroscopy may be utilized demonstrating elevated peaks of lactate, choline, and myoinositol, and reduced N-acetylaspartate signal. \n\nFollow-up imaging demonstrates progressive abnormalities with worsening involvement of the contralateral temporal lobe, insula, and cingulate gyri.

The incidence of incidentalomas has been estimated to be as high as 1.4% to 10% based on autopsies, but in actual practice occur at a frequency of .35% to 5%.         \n\n       Amongst the various imaging modalities available to the clinical/surgical team, CT is the most useful for evaluating adrenal masses.  Utilizing 5 mm collimations, tumors as small as 10 mm may be detected.  Although not accepted in clinical practice, multiple studies indicate that low HU masses are more likely to be benign than malignant.   One series indicates that masses less than 18 HU are benign (85% sensitivity, 100% specificity).  Another set of studies states that those less than 10 HU are benign (73% sensitivity, 96% specificity).   Another factor to consider in evaluation for malignancy is the size of the lesion.  The greater the size of the lesion, the greater the likelihood of adrenal carcinoma versus adenoma.  Lesions less than 3 cm on CT are unlikely to be malignant, whereas lesions greater than 6 cm are usually carcinomas.  In addition metastases tend to be less then 4 cm in size.\n      Plain films, ultrasound, and tomograms are not as sensitive, whereas angiography, and scintigraphy are too invasive.  MRI is indicated if malignancy or a pheochromocytoma is suspected.   On T1 or T2 weighted MRI, a benign adrenal adenoma will have the same signal intensity as the surrounding adrenal tissue.  On the other hand, a pheochromocytoma will have a very high signal intensity relative to the surrounding tissue on T2 weighted MRI.  An adrenal carcinoma will be hyperintense relative to the liver, but less so than a pheochromocytoma; and metastatic lesions will similarly have a high signal intensity but not as high as a pheochromocytoma.  Dynamic gadolinium enhanced MRI has been demonstrated to have over 90% specificity and sensitivity in differentiating benign from malignant adrenal masses.\n       Fine needle aspiration is very fine for differentiating metastatic versus primary adrenal tumor with 80-100% sensitivity.  However, it is not quite as good at differentiating benign versus malignant primary tumors (54-86% sensitivity).   However, this is countered by the fact that primary adrenal tumors are usually greater than 6 cm, whereas metastatases are usually less than 4 cm.\n       Other imaging modalities include nuclear scintigraphy with cholesterol radiotracers (I 19-iodocholesterol and selenomethylnorcholesterol [scintiadren]).  Non hypersecrecting adenomas and tumors secreting cortisol, aldosterone and androgen demonstrate increased uptake. \n      One other powerful and exciting imaging modality is positron emission tomography scanning, particularly when fused with CT scans.  PET has proven to be 100% sensitive and specific in differentiating benign and metastatic lesions.  18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging and 131-I MIBG imaging have been used for pheochromocytomas.  111-In octreotide imaging is also used.\n       85-90% of pheochromocytomas originate from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.   The other 10% are extramedullary in origin and more properly termed paragangliomas.  The vast majority are benign with just 10% of them being malignant.   While we are tossing tens around, 10% of pheochromocytomas are found in childhood, 10% are familial, meaning that they are found in certain syndromes.\n      Pheochromocytomas cause paroxysmal or persistent hypertension due to excess epinephrine/normetanephrine production.   However, only .1-.3% of hypertensive patients have this as cause of hypertension.  Less than half of the patients with pheochromocytoma present with paroxysmal hypertension.  The majority have chronic hypertension, or chronic hypertension with overlying lability.  Paroxysms can be triggered by stress, exercise, posture change, palpation, smoking, and even urination.  Other symptoms include tachycardia, palpitations, headache, sweating, tremor, anxiety and a sense of impending doom. Less frequent symptoms include abdominal or chest pain, nausea and vomiting.  Hypertension can lead to CHF, pulmonary edema, MI, ventricular fibrillation and CVAs.  Catecholamine cardiomyopathy describes the damage to the heart due to pheochromocytoma:   the process of cardiac  ischemic damage secondary to catecholamine induced vasomotor constriction of myocardial circulation or direct toxicity from catecholamines.\n    Occasionally, pheochromocytomas elaborate other steroids or peptides, leading to syndromes such as Cushing’s.  Classically, however, catecholamine secreting pheochromocytoma is diagnosed by increased urinary excretion of catecholamines, their metabolites (VMA), and metanephrines, and the imaging modalities described above.  Certain medications may confound diagnosis by falsely elevating catecholamines.  These include TCAs, BZDs, amphetamines; labetalol, L-dopa, methyldopa, clonidine, and alcohol.\n      Pheochromocytomas occasionally (10%) occur in familial, mainly autosomal dominant syndrome including : MEN II a or II b, tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel-Lindau, von Recklinghausen and Sturge-Weber syndrome.  Familial forms occur mainly in childhood with a male preponderance.  Non-familial forms typically occur between 40-60 years of age with a slight female preponderance.\n      After diagnosis, pheochromocytomas must be localized with the use of CT, MRI, MIBG, and PET scans.  98% are found in the abdominal cavity, but pheochromocytomas can be found anywhere from the base of the skull to the pelvis, in a para-aortic or para-vertebral location.  Occult pheochromocytomas are classically found in the bladder, or in the organ of Zuckerkandl (which is located superior to the branching of the inferior mesenteric artery, anterior to the aorta).\n      Pheochromocytomas must be removed surgically.  It is absolutely essential to modulate catecholamine release pre-operatively by administering alpha blockers (usu phenoxybenzamine 40-160 mg QD divided) in sufficient dose to cause nasal stuffiness or borderline hypotension. Beta blockade with propanolol to control excess beta stimulation (tachycardia/cardiac arrhythmia) is doen AFTER alpha blockade.  Otherwise peripheral perfusion may be compromised.  Volume replace for adequate circulating volume if necessary.  Utilize a midline or transverse incision to explore the adrenals bilaterally and explore the paraaortic and paracaval retroperitoneum from diaphragm to pelvis.  Laparoscopic adrenalectomy utilizing a flank, retroperitoneal or transabdominal approach is a newer technique which offers lower morbidity, and decreased hospital stay.  However, the surgeon must be sure to localize all tumors in advance via imaging studies.", "keywords": "pheochromocytoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1683_synpic16676", "MPX1683_synpic16677", "MPX1683_synpic16678"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1683_synpic16676", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1683_synpic16676.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Abdomen", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Abdominal CT demonstrates a mass adjacent to the left kidney with distinct borders.

Too often the thrombosis develops well before the symptoms manifest themselves and the symptoms are the result of the affected territories.  \n\n     The diffusion findings in human cerebral venous infarction are controversial though most recent studies describe high signal intensity on diffusion images that correspond to low signal intensity on ADC images.   These signal findings have been attributed to cytotoxic edema.  In direct contrast, some studies showed decreased to no increase in signal on diffusion images and increased to slightly decreased signal on ADC map.  It is believed these findings represent early vasogenic edema perhaps in combination with early cytotoxic edema.  The truth is likely to represent spectrum signal variation in both diffusion and ADC images that evolves over the course of the pathologic insult.  \n     \n     Treatment of this condition often involves heparin and/or coumadin depending on the current condition of the patient and pregnancy status.  In some patients who continue to deteriorate, aggressive micro catheter directed dural venous sinus thrombolysis with urokinase or other thrombolytic agents has shown clinical benefit.  The use of mechanical thrombolysis is usually reserved for patients who have poor response to local infusions of urokinase and rapid neurological decline and/or contraindications to thrombolytics.", "keywords": "ThrombosisCortical Venous SystemDural Sinus", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1247_synpic24621"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1247_synpic24621", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1247_synpic24621.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MRA - MR Angiography/Venography", "plane": "3D Reconstruction", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Coronally oriented 3D MRV/MRI image shows a filling defect along the right outer convexity when compared to the contralateral side.

Of these only the lipoma would be soft enough to be flattened by abdominal compression.  The absence of an associated exoenteric mass would be against the diagnosis of carcinoid, a more frequently found small bowel tumor.  Lack of ulceration together with the softness of the tumor would be against a leiomyoma, a slightly more frequent small bowel tumor than a lipoma.  The benign character of this tumor is supported by the long history and its smoothly round surface appearance.\n\nThe benign character of the tumor would have been rendered definite if lack of significant growth could have been shown by a further examination one or two years later.  This could be demonstrated in another case included here to underline this point.  Film .3 is a small bowel meal study done at another hospital in a patient who complained of intermittent pain.  Arrows outline an oval shaped, smooth intraluminal tumor.  The patient's symptoms continued and a small bowel enema was done two years later.  Film .4 demonstrates the same elongated intraluminal lesion which had not appreciably increased in size during the two years; a lipoma was removed at surgery.\n\nAll benign small bowel tumors are rare, leiomyoma and lipoma being the least infrequent.  Though lipomas arise in submucosal fat, their slow growth is deflected by the muscularis and directed into the bowel lumen to make them present like a mucosal polyp.  They will occasionally ulcerate and bleed.  More frequently, they will transiently intussuscept to give rise to crampy abdominal pain, the symptoms of the first patient in this case.  The diagnosis of lipoma can be supported by CT when it would show an attenuation number compatible with fat.\n\nFURTHER CASE EXAMPLE:  A 50-year-old man complained of crampy abdominal pain of sudden onset; stools were heme positive; a small bowel enema (Film .5) outlined an almost 2-cm rounded, intraluminal filling defect with slight surface irregularity (arrow) seen at the top of the film; in the course of the barium study (Film .6) the lesion was seen to intussuscept and advance about 4 cm (arrows indicate the narrow passage through the intussusception).  The differential diagnosis included lipoma, lymphoma (very rare as a single polypoid lesion), carcinoid (they virtually never intussuscept) and inflammatory fibroid polyp (very rare).

CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation has become the treatment of choice for most osteoid osteomas located in the appendicular skeleton and pelvis, and a success rate of 91% has been demonstrated.   After needle biopsy, the radiofrequency electrode is introduced under CT guidance and the tip is heated to 90?C and maintained for 3-6 minutes.  This technique is limited because the electrode must be positioned at least 1 cm away from major nerves.  Therefore, lesions in some locations such as the hand or vertebral column make poor candidates.", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Osteoid osteoma", "acr_code": "4.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "Osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor of the bone, which accounts for approximately 12% 2of all benign skeletal tumors.  Over 50% of the time this tumor occurs in the proximal femur and tibia with another 13% occurring in the vertebral columns, especially the posterior elements.1  Generally, these lesions occur in the intracortical and diaphyseal portions of the long bones, although they can occur in the metaphysis of the bone as well.2  The typical history associated with an osteoid osteoma is that of a person in his or her teens to twenties with nocturnal pain which responds well to aspirin.2,3  The radiologic findings of this tumor classically consist of a small (usually less than 1.5 to 2 cm) sclerotic lesion with a cortically based radiolucency (nidus).2  Surrounding the sclerosis is cortical thickening which is secondary to an extensive surrounding inflammatory response.2  While this appearance may be evident on plain film, often a CT or MRI is necessary to identify these characteristic changes, however, MRI should be used with the understanding that this method of imaging can make the appearance of an osteoid osteoma confusing.  MRI will show the sometimes extensive bone marrow reactions (which correlate with replacement of normal marrow with fibrous tissue, inflammatory cells, and hypervascularity) and soft tissue inflammation which are associated with an osteoid osteoma and the calcified nidus is often not seen with this imaging modality.  Instead, MRI can suggest that a more aggressive process is occurring, such as malignancy, infection, or fracture.2   Intra-articular osteoid osteomas create problems not seen with the typical diaphyseal lesion.  These can cause joint effusion and lymhoproliferative synovitis, and may suggest an arthritic condition.  Indeed, this may lead to osteoarthritis in up to half of these patients.2 In the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, the classic appearance on plain film or CT in addition to the classic history which appears in this case generally makes the diagnosis for the radiologist and the clinician.  However there are several important other processes which are necessary to rule out.  The most important of these processes is an osteosarcoma.  This condition typically will not have the central nidus of calcification, but more importantly it will not respect the boundaries which an osteoid osteoma respects and stay in the cortex of the bone.  While the pain may occur more strongly at night, the patient will typically not obtain strong relief from aspirin or other NSAIDs, as he or she will with an osteoid osteoma.Of the conditions which do respect the boundaries of the bone and are localized to the cortex, there are only three possibilities: osteiod osteoma, Langerhan’s cell histiocytosis, and Brodie’s abscess.2  Langerhan’s cell histiocytosis typically occurs in the skull and spine, with typical lesions being lytic with well defined margins.  Skull lesions have sharply defined punched out boarders (giving rise to “geographic skull”); spine lesions lead to variable compression of the vertebral bodies.2  Brodie’s abscess is a subacute osteomyelitis that commonly occurs as a well defined osteolytic metaphyseal lesion.  It has a sclerotic margin that fades peripherally, creating a “fuzzy” appearance.  There is no central nidus.  Occasionally Brodie’s abscess occurs as a serpiginous lucency in the metaphysis of the long bone.  These findings are often pathognomonic on plain fims.  The most common causative organism is S. aureus. 4", "keywords": "Osteoid osteoma", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1503_synpic29643", "MPX1503_synpic29644", "MPX1503_synpic29645"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1503_synpic29643", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1503_synpic29643.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "NOS - Not specified", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Fig. 2A.

The patient demonstrated full range of motion of his right lower extremity, however, pain was exacerbated by forced extension of the right knee.\n\nImaging Findings:\nAP and lateral (lateral not shown) radiographs of the right femur demonstrated a zone of cortical thickening with a smooth contour along the medial aspect of the distal right femoral metadiaphysis (Fig 1).  A central lucency measuring 2.5 cm craniocaudal can be seen with a small component of associated cortical penetration.  No surrounding soft tissue abnormalities were evident.  \n\nMR T1 coronal image (Fig. 2) demonstrates the wide cortical thickening with associated cortical penetration. \n\nFollow-up MR imaging validated the cortical thickening as low signal intensity. On T2-weighted images a nidus in the mid femoral shaft was noted with high signal intensity and enhancement following administration of intravenous gadolinium (Figs. 3&4). There is marked bone production medially, with adjacent bone marrow edema involving the mid femoral shaft.\n\nNuclear medicine bone scan (Fig. 5)reveals intense focal uptake eccentrically in the right distal third of the femur.", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

To being with, the common hepatic artery usually arises from the celiac trunk (86%).  Other sources include the superior mesenteric artery (2.9%), the aorta (1.1%), and rarely, the left gastric artery. \n\nWhen it originates from the celiac axis, the common hepatic artery runs horizontally along the upper border of the head of the pancreas. The gastroduodenal artery branches off the common hepatic artery posterior and superior to the duodenum. The common hepatic artery then continues as the proper hepatic artery and turns upward to ascend in the hepatoduodenal ligament, in front of the epiploic (Winslow's) foramen. Within the hepatoduodenal ligament, the proper hepatic artery lies to the left of the common bile duct and anterior to the portal vein. Within the ligament the proper hepatic artery divides into the right and left hepatic arteries. Arterial distribution to different functional segments is identical to the distribution of portal vein The right hepatic artery passes to the right behind (or occasionally in front of) the hepatic duct in front of the portal vein. Before entering the liver, the right hepatic artery gives off the cystic artery in the hepatocystic triangle located between the cystic duct and the common bile duct.\n\nAberrant hepatic arteries are found in about 45% of subjects. If the arteries arise entirely from some source other than the celiac arterial distribution, they are called replaced arteries and can supply an entire lobe of the liver or even the entire liver. Atypical hepatic arteries are commonly called accessory arteries if they arise from some aberrant source and are additive to lobar branches. Even so, it should be noted that they often provide the primary arterial supply to a specific portion of the liver and therefore are not accessory arteries. These aberrant hepatic arteries should be distinguished from segmental arteries arising outside the liver.\n \nThe most common occurrences of aberrant hepatic arteries involve , the left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery, which comprises 25-30% of instances.

It is responsible for approximately 2% of adult malignancies.  Male-female ration is 1.5:1.  Age at presentation ranges from 50 to 70 years, with a median age at diagnosis of 57 years. Risk factors for RCC inclued tobacco use, long-term phenacetin use, Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD), chronic dialysis, and family history.\n\nBilateral RCC commonly develops in patients with VHLD, tuberous sclerosis, acquired cystic kidney disease and familial RCC.  Bilateral neoplasms occur in less than 2% of patients with sporadic RCC.  This tumor may spread via local extension, hematogenously, or by the lymphatic system. \n\nROBSON CLASSIFICATION FOR STAGING OF RCC:\n     I    - Tumor confined to renal capsule\n     II   - Tumor extends throught renal capsule but is confined    \n            to renal fascia.

Tumor embolization may be used to minimize blood loss during surgery or to produce palliation. Objective tumor regression after treatment with hormonal agents is achieved in less than 6% of patients. Immunotherapy is mainly used in patients with metastatic RCC after resection of primary tumors with successful results in about 20% to 30% of patients with 5% to 10% complete responses. RCC is relatively radioresistant tumor. The role of radiation therapy is primarily in preoperative reduction in the size and fixation of tumors.\n\nCT FINDINGS IN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA\n     - Most occur in the renal cortex and demonstrate an exophytic growth pattern.  They distort the renal contour and larger tumors involve both the renal cortex and medulla.  Solid tumors may be hyperdense, hypodense, or hyperdense on non-enhanced CT. Some lesions may appear heterogenous on non-enhanced scans because of hemorrhage and necrosis.  Tumor calcification occurs in approximately 30% of cases.  They may also rarely demonstrate small amounts of adipose tissue.  A combination of fat and calcification shoud suggest RCC because fat-containing AMLs do not usually calcify. Solid RCCs usually demonstrates heterogenous enhancement(>10 HU).  2% to 5% of RCCs are predominantly cystic. Filling defects (clots, tumor thrombus) in the collecting sytem and renal veins may be seen.", "keywords": "renal cell carcinoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1582_synpic39368", "MPX1582_synpic39369", "MPX1582_synpic39370", "MPX1582_synpic39371", "MPX1582_synpic39372", "MPX1582_synpic39373", "MPX1582_synpic39374", "MPX1582_synpic39375", "MPX1582_synpic39376", "MPX1582_synpic39377"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1582_synpic39368", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1582_synpic39368.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Axial CT images after intravenous contrast material administration demonstrate an aggressive enhancing heterogenous exophytic mass arising from the upper pole of the left kidney and extending into the left renal vein.

The bile ducts become filled with stones (usually pigment stones), pus and sludge-like material.  The intra- and extrahepatic ducts become focally and irregularly dilated secondary to multiple strictures.  Distal obstruction is not usually present.  Biliary cirrhosis from longstanding obstruction may ultimately develop.  The disease seems to involve the left ductal system more severely.\n\nYoung adults are most commonly affected.  Clinical symptoms include fever, chills, RUQ pain and jaundice.  Septic shock and liver abscess may develop.\n\nThe etiology of this condition is debated.  Multiple pathogenic factors are proposed, including repeated infections with enteric organisms, malnutrition, parasitic infestation and portal bacteremia.  It is postulated that enteric bacteria deconjugate bilirubin and predispose to pigment calculi formation.  Parasitic infection with Clonorchis sinensis or Fasciola hepatica commonly coexist and may contribute to the pathogenesis.  However the most common organism culture from the bile in patients with RPC is E. coli\n\nThe diagnosis is often suggested on CT or US by asymmetric or patchy intrahepatic ductal dilatation and intra- and extrahepatic duct calculi.  The disease most commonly effects the lateral left lobe.  Calculi are multiple, vary in size, consistency and color and are frequently non-calcified.  Air in the bile ducts (with no previous surgery), contrast enhancement of the ductal walls, and parenchymal changes of segmental atrophy, fatty change and hepatic abscesses may also be identified on CT.  CT should be done without oral or IV contrast initially.  Intrahepatic calculi are more easily detected on non-enhanced scans, and oral contrast refluxing through an anastomosis may obscure calculi.\n\nOn sonography, the biliary sludge and amorphous intrahepatic calculi can be missed, appearing as soft tissue density without an acoustic shadow and obscuring visibility of dilated intrahepatic ducts.  Pneumobilia may be mistaken for intrahepatic calculi.  Biliary  Direct cholangiography with PTC or ERCP is used to delineate specific details but must be done carefully with prophylactic antibiotics.\n\nThere is a high recurrence rate in this disease.  Medical therapy is ineffective.  Percutaneous or endoscopic drainage, stone removal and stricture dilatation are useful in management.  Resection of the affect portion of the liver and choledocojejunostomy may be performed to improve biliary drainage and protect the unaffected portions of the liver.

About 90% to 95% of hiatal hernias found by radiograph are sliding hernias, and the rest are paraesophageal or mixed.  Most sliding hiatal hernias are small and of little clinical significance. Patients with symptomatic paraesophageal hernias are most often middle-aged to elderly.  Many patients with small, simple sliding hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. The main clinical significance of the sliding hiatal hernia is its contribution to gastroesophageal reflux . In addition to heartburn and regurgitation, patients with large sliding hiatal hernias may complain of dysphagia or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen. In a prospective, population-based study the risk of iron-deficiency anemia was found to be increased  in adults with hiatal hernia. On chest radiograph a hiatal hernia may be noted as a soft tissue density in the retrocardiac area. Hiatal hernias are most often diagnosed on upper gastrointestinal barium radiographic studies. At endoscopy the gastroesophageal junction is noted to be proximal to the impression of the diaphragm. [1]\n\nPatients with paraesophageal and mixed hiatal hernias are rarely completely asymptomatic if closely questioned. About half of patients with paraesophageal hernias have gastroesophageal reflux. Other symptoms include dysphagia, chest pain, vague postprandial discomfort, and shortness of breath. A substantial number of patients have chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. If the hernia is complicated by gastric volvulus, acute abdominal pain and retching will occur, often progressing rapidly to a surgical emergency. A paraesophageal or mixed hiatal hernia may be seen on chest radiograph as an abnormal soft tissue density (often with a gas bubble) in the mediastinum. Upper gastrointestinal radiograph is the best diagnostic study. [1]\n\nHiatal hernias are occasionally complicated by volvulus. The stomach is normally fixed in position by ligamentous attachments to the duodenum, spleen, liver, and diaphragm. Laxity of these ligaments, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, adhesions, gastric tumor, or masses in adjacent organs may predispose to volvulus. In about one third of cases the volvulus occurs below the diaphragm. In the other two thirds of cases volvulus occurs above the diaphragm in association with a diaphragmatic hernia. Sliding hiatal hernias are not associated with gastric volvulus.  Gastric volvulus may be mesenteroaxial or organoaxial. In about 60% of cases gastric volvulus is organoaxial: the stomach twists along its long axis. This axis usually passes through the gastroesophageal and gastropyloric junctions. The antrum rotates anteriorly and superiorly, the fundus posteriorly and inferiorly, twisting the greater curvature at some point along its length. This type of volvulus is commonly associated with a diaphragmatic hernia. Organoaxial volvulus is usually an acute event. Vascular compromise and gastric infarction may occur. The other major type of gastric volvulus is mesenteroaxial, in which the stomach folds on its short axis running across from the lesser curvature to the greater curvature, and the antrum twists anteriorly and superiorly. [1]\n\nSimple sliding hiatal hernias do not require treatment. Patients with symptomatic giant sliding hiatal hernias, paraesophageal, and mixed hernias should be offered surgery. Many experts suggest that surgery should be offered to patients with asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias, because about 30% of these patients will develop complications if left untreated. Many surgeons routinely perform a fundoplication on all repairs, both to prevent postoperative reflux esophagitis and to fix the stomach in the abdomen. Less commonly a gastrostomy is used to fix the stomach in position. Patients with sliding hiatal or paraesophageal hernias may have shortening of the esophagus. This makes it difficult to restore the gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragm without tension. In such cases an extra length of neoesophagus can be constructed from the proximal stomach (Colles-Nissen procedure). Paraesophageal and mixed hernias can be repaired through the chest or abdomen, with open or laparoscopic techniques. Compared with open repair, laparoscopic repair is associated with less blood loss, fewer overall complications, shorter hospital stay, and quicker return to normal activities. Long-term results are probably equal with either approach. Potential surgical complications include esophageal and gastric perforation, pneumothorax, and liver laceration. Potential long-term complications may include dysphagia if the wrap is too tight or gastroesophageal reflux if the fundoplication breaks down or migrates into the chest. Recurrence rates are about 10 [1]\n \n\n1.

These tumors are formed by hyperproliferation of the nerve sheath cells.  Although they can occasionally undergo malignant transformation, invade CNS spaces, or cause mental retardation, significant morbidity can result from hundreds of disfiguring neurofibromas and pedunculated molluscum fibrosum visible from a long distance.  The psychological impact and physical inconvenience of such lesions cannot be overstated.  \n\tNF-1 is disease whose gene with autosomal dominant inheritance involving an NF-1 gene on chromosome 17.  However, as many as half of cases occur by spontaneous genetic defect with no known parental disease.  This genetic defect is found in nearly 1 per 3000 births with varying expression.  There is no increased incidence by sex or race.\n\tThe diagnosis is generally made in childhood or adolescence due to the appearance of caf?-au-lait macules.

Type III lesions involve a bucket-handle tear of the superior labrum (a vertical tear through a meniscoid-like superior labrum) without extension into the biceps tendon.  The biceps anchor is stable and the remaining labrum is intact. Type IV lesions also involve a bucket-handle tear associated with a meniscoid-type superior labrum, but in this case with extension into the biceps tendon.

A complex SLAP lesion may consist of a combination of two or more types, usually type II and type IV.\n\nPossible mechanisms of injury include a fall on the outstretched abducted arm with associated superior joint compression and a proximal subluxation force or a sudden contraction of the biceps tendon, which avulses the superior labrum. Repetitive stress acting through the biceps tendon or instability of the glenohumeral joint may also produce SLAP lesions. \n\nTreatment of SLAP lesions is based on the type of labral lesion present.

Typically the tumor cells can follow the optic nerve into the CNS proper and invade the surrounding structures. Typically, extension into the brain is accompanied by a neurologic deficit.\n\nIn the past the primary treatment of PIOL has been optic radiation.

Spread of infection is mainly hematogenous, however vertebral osteomyelitis can result from non-hematogenous sources such as direct inoculation from spinal surgery and penetrating trauma.  Blood-borne bacteria can seed the vertebral bodies via the spinal arteries. The primary venous route for extension from the pelvis to the spine is Batson’s vertebral venous plexus. This plexus contains no valves and is of variable direction, depending on the intra-abdominal pressure. Vertebral body endplates are well vascularized, and it is within the large venous sinusoids that the multidirectional blood flow allows the infection to spread throughout the vertebral bodies.

In a patient of this age and with his history of atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis, left atrial thrombus and infective endocarditis were high on the differential for the embolic source.\n\nThe patient underwent two transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) evaluating for possible endocarditis. Both TTEs were negative for atrial thrombus, and neither could effectively image the aortic valve due to the high level of valvular calcification present. It should be noted that TTE has a relatively low sensitivity (high false negative rate) for visualizing left atrial appendage thrombi compared to TEE and cardiac-gated CT.\n\nA transesophageal echocardiogram was bypassed after the patient was deemed not to be a good surgical candidate (based on age and comorbidities); this cardiac-gated CT scan was later performed instead to evaluate for the embolic source. The CT scan showed no evidence of infective endocarditis, but did reveal a filling defect within the left atrial appendage. Of note, single-phase contrast imaging with cardiac-gated CT can have a falsely positive filling defect in the left atrial appendage, especially in cases of atrial fibrillation when the atria may be dilated and/or there is little contractility to allow adequate contrast mixing within the appendage. Key to this study is the late-phase imaging, which showed contrast filling the atrial appendage and highlighting the presence of a thrombus. This finding was pathognomonic. \n\nCardiac tumors, including atrial myxomas and papillary fibroelastomas (as well as metastatic disease), are other possibilities, but are considerably more rare; thus, they remain low on the differential diagnosis.", "topic_title": "Left atrial appendage thrombus", "acr_code": "5.7", "category": "Vascular", "disease_discussion": "The three classic mechanisms for thrombus formation include blood flow stasis, blood vessel wall damage, and a hypercoagulable state. All three of these are thought to contribute to the development of thrombi in patients with atrial fibrillation. This has considerable clinical relevance, with atrial fibrillation being a major cause of thromboembolic disease leading to serious morbidity and mortality.\n\nWhile thrombus formation is possible anywhere within the heart depending on variations in anatomy and function of the atria, ventricles and valves, the left atrial appendage is of particular interest. Low blood velocities in the atrial appendage result in high incidences of thrombus formation compared to elsewhere in the heart. Roughly 90% of thrombi in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation arise in, or associated with, the left atrial appendage. It is thought that the anatomy of the appendage, with its relatively small communication to the left atrium and the presence of trabeculations, predisposes the area to low blood flow. In patients with atrial fibrillation, atrial contractile function decreases significantly, and there is relative blood stasis in the appendage leading to thrombus formation.\n\nTraditionally, the left atrial appendage has been best evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE); while more invasive than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), TEE was found to be much more effective at visualizing thrombi in the atria and the left atrial appendage. More recently, cardiac-gated computed tomography (CT) angiography has been shown to have thrombus detection values very similar to that of TEE (sensitivity and specificity values near 100%). Cardiac-gated CT may become the preferred modality for evaluation of suspected thromboembolic disease from a cardiac source in cases where TEE is not tolerated or non-diagnostic.\n\nThrombus formation in patients with atrial fibrillation is counteracted in the majority of moderate to high risk patients with warfarin therapy. However, a sizable proportion of patients are unable to take oral anticoagulation therapy due to contraindications or are non-compliant. For this reason, there are techniques used to close the left atrial appendage, either in an open approach during surgery (for valve replacement, for example) or, more recently, with percutaneous devices. Long term outcome studies are still pending, however, left atrial appendage occlusion may become a viable method for stroke prevention in patients unable to take oral anticoagulants.", "keywords": "atrial appendagethromboembolismatrial fibrillation", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1663_synpic51009", "MPX1663_synpic51013", "MPX1663_synpic51015"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1663_synpic51009", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1663_synpic51009.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Early phase cardiac gated CT w/ contrast: Filling defect within the left atrial appendage.", "age": "80", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "5.7", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1663_synpic51013", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1663_synpic51013.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Calcific stenosis of the aortic valve.", "age": "80", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "5.7", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1663_synpic51015", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1663_synpic51015.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Late-phase image: Thrombus within the left atrial appendage.", "age": "80", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "5.7", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n80 year-old man with a known history of rate-controlled atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis presented one week prior to study with facial droop.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nLeft sided facial droop with noted drooling.\n\nINR 1.3\n\nImaging Findings:\n•  There is a low-attenuating mass in the left atrial appendage.

The average age of onset is in the adult between the ages of 40- 60 with a greater predisposition for men.  The distribution is more common in the flat bones, especially the shoulder and pelvis.  The presentation is most commonly of the exostotic type, as a large calcified mass in a vertebral body developing into the paraspinal tissue.  The center of the tumor is often calcified with stippling and mottling with underlying bone distruction with a thick cap of sarcomatous cartilage surrounding the calcified mass. The causes include de novo appearance, malignant transformation of an enchondroma, or development from the cartilaginous cap of an osteochondroma.  The clinical hx is often one of an indolent pain, swelling, with a progressive increase in size to the point of compression of neighboring organs, nerve root, or spinal cord compression.  The cartilage emits a high T2 signal on MRI.  Treatment is radical surgical resection due to the fact that the tumor is very refractory to chemotherapy.

However, in order to detect small hiatal hernias, one must use high-resolution manometry.\n-Etiology-trauma, congenital malformation, and iatrogenic factors. \n-Prognosis-Most small hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. With larger type I hernias, the main clinical implication is the propensity to develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). \n\nType II, III, and IV: Paraesophageal hernias  — account for up to 5 percent of all hiatal hernias. \nEtiology: usually unclear, but a recognized complication of surgical dissection of the hiatus as occurs during antireflux procedures, esophagomyotomy, or partial gastrectomy.\n-Description: As the hernia enlarges, the greater curvature of the stomach rolls up into the thorax. Because the stomach is fixed at the gastroesophageal junction, the herniated stomach tends to rotate around its longitudinal axis, resulting in an organoaxial volvulus. \n-Diagnosis: barium swallow or endoscopy. If the hernia involves organs other than just the stomach, a definitive diagnosis is established with CT or MRI.\n\nTypes III and IV hiatal hernias are variants of the type II hernia:\n-Type III -with progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal membrane stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm. \n-Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal membrane, allowing other organs, such as the colon, spleen, pancreas, and small intestine, to enter the hernia sac. \n\nSYMPTOMS — usually discovered as a finding on upper gastrointestinal studies or endoscopy. \nType II-vague, intermittent symptoms, epigastric or substernal pain, postprandial fullness, substernal fullness, nausea, and retching. An upright radiograph of the thorax may be diagnostic, revealing a retrocardiac air-fluid level within a paraesophageal hernia or intrathoracic stomach. \n\nTREATMENT — Repair of an isolated, asymptomatic type I hiatal hernia is rarely indicated. If symptoms of GERD occur in association with a large hiatus hernia, either medical or surgical treatment is indicated to control the reflux.\nIn contrast, the enlarging types II, III, and IV hernias pose a constant risk of serious complications. These hernias never regress and progressively enlarge. If left untreated, the paraesophageal hernia eventually reaches the stage of the giant intrathoracic stomach, at which point the prognosis is poor and the complication rate is high. Thus, once a paraesophageal hernia is identified, it should be treated surgically even in the absence of symptoms.", "keywords": "Hiatal herniaParaesophageal herniaGastroesophageal junction", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2015_synpic50876"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2015_synpic50876", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2015_synpic50876.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "-The study is somewhat limited by motion artifact.

The damaged structures may include the vestibular nuclei (nystagmus, oscillopsia, vertigo, nausea, vomiting); spinothalamic tract (contralateral impairment of pain and thermal sense over half the body); descending sympathetic fibers (ipsilateral Horner syndrome – miosis, ptosis, decreased sweating); fibers of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves (hoarseness, dysphagia, ipsilateral paralysis of the palate and vocal cord, diminished gag reflex); otolithic nucleus (vertical diplopia and illusion of tilting of vision); spinal trigeminal tract (pain, burning, and impaired sensation over ipsilateral half of face); nucleus and tractus solitarus (loss of taste); olivocerebellar or spinocerebellar fibers, restiform body and inferior cerebullum (ipsilateral ataxia of limbs, falling or toppling to the ipsilateral side).  This syndrome is almost always secondary to infarction, with only a small portion being the result of hemorrhage or tumor.  Most patients recover well, although reports of sudden and unexpected death may occur from respiratory or cardiac arrest in the absence of cerebellar swelling or basilar artery thrombosis.\n\nIt is interesting to note, there was no restricted diffusion indicating this was not an acute event.  Burdette et al. report that infarctions greater than two weeks old, will demonstrate no signal abnormalities on diffusion-weighted imaging. Additionally, contrast enhancement in subacute strokes with iodinated contrast agents is well understood, and is secondary to extravasation of contrast material through a leaky blood-brain barrier.  Likewise, similar findings were documented in this case with enhancement of the lateral medulla following the administration of gadolinium DTPA, consistent with a subacute infarct.\n\nReferences:\nAdams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology.  7th Edition.

The most common type is the subintimal dissection, although subadventitial dissections (clot extension in the plane between the media and adventitia) also occur. \n\nTwo theories exist with regard to the etiology of dissections, each of which invokes intimal injury as a final common pathway: \n1). An intimal tear occurs, allowing clot propagation within the vessel wall. \n2). A primary intramural hematoma develops and eventually ruptures through the intimal lining into the vessel lumen. \n\nTraumatic dissections result from three basic mechanisms of injury: \n\n1). Penetrating injuries, which include gunshot wounds, knife wounds, intra-oral trauma (pencils, sticks). With regard to characterizing the location of penetrating injuries, the neck is divided into three anatomic zones: \n*Zone 1: below the level of the cricoid cartilage. \n*Zone 2: between the level of the cricoid and the level of the mandibular angle. \n*Zone 3: superior to the level of the mandibular angle. \n\n2). Nonpenetrating injury due to spine fracture-subluxation injuries. \n\n3). Blunt injury to the carotid arteries. \n\nVertebral artery dissections account for approximately 20% of cases of cervical vascular injuries and most commonly occur between the skull base and the upper cervical spine. Less commonly, the injury occurs between the vessel’s origin from the subclavian artery and the C6 foramen transversarium. Mid-cervical vertebral artery injuries occur in approximately 5% of patient with fractures involving the foramina transversaria. \n\nInternal carotid artery dissections are the most common of all craniocervical dissections, frequently (70% of cases) involve both the cervical and petrous segments of the ICA, and usually spare the carotid bulb. Dissections involving the intracranial internal carotid artery segments, while rare, do occur. \n\nThe radiographic appearance of the contrast-opacified vertebral artery on the lateral view is as follows: the vertebral artery takes a nearly vertical course as it traverses the C6 through C3 foramina transversaria. Immediately after passing through the vertebral canal of C2, the vessel forms an inverted L and turns laterally within C2. It then exits C2 and turns cephalad to pass through the vertebral canal of C1. On exiting the transverse foramen of the atlas, it then courses sharply posteriorly along the posterior ring of C1, completing the appearance of a half square. Finally, it turns anterosuperiorly (a hairpin turn) to pierce the dura as it passes through the foramen magnum.", "keywords": "vertebral arterydissectionpontine infarct", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2563_synpic41792", "MPX2563_synpic41793", "MPX2563_synpic41794", "MPX2563_synpic41795", "MPX2563_synpic41796", "MPX2563_synpic41797", "MPX2563_synpic41798", "MPX2563_synpic41799", "MPX2563_synpic41800", "MPX2563_synpic41801", "MPX2563_synpic41802", "MPX2563_synpic41803", "MPX2563_synpic41804", "MPX2563_synpic41807", "MPX2563_synpic41808", "MPX2563_synpic41809", "MPX2563_synpic41810", "MPX2563_synpic41811", "MPX2563_synpic41814", "MPX2563_synpic41815", "MPX2563_synpic41816", "MPX2563_synpic41817"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41792", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41792.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted sagittal image of the left vertebral artery reveal a normal T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41793", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41793.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted sagittal images of the right vertebral artery reveal a diminished T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41794", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41794.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted sagittal image of the left vertebral artery reveals normal T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41795", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41795.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - FIESTA", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "FIESTA 3D sagittal image of the right vertebral artery reveals loss of the normal T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41796", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41796.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - FIESTA", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "FIESTA 3D sagittal image of the left vertebral artery in the paramedullary cistern reveals a normal T2 signal related flow void.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41797", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41797.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - FIESTA", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "FIESTA 3D sagittal image of the right vertebral artery in the right paramedullary cistern reveals loss of the normal T2 signal related flow void, and a small amount of increased signal in the expected distribution of the right vertebral artery.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41798", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41798.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted axial image at the level of C2 reveals abnormal increased T2 signal involving the right vertebral artery, consistent with intramural hematoma.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41799", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41799.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted axial image at the level of the occiptal condyles reveal loss of the normal T2 signal related flow void of the right vertebral artery in the paramedullary cistern.", "age": "28", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "3.4", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2563_synpic41800", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2563_synpic41800.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 weighted axial image at the level of the medulla oblongata reveals abnormal increased signal intensity in the right vertebral artery in the paramedullary cistern.

Other associations include radiation exposure, asbestos exposure, occupational inhaled substances (especially nickel, chromates, and arsenic), genetically dominant oncogenes, and loss of tumor suppressor genes.\n\nDemographics (Age, Sex, Incidence): Cancer of the lung occurs most often between the ages of 40 and 70, with a peak incidence in the 6th or 7th decade. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes and the male:female death ratio is about 3:1. The annual death rate for lung cancer is about 70/100,000 for males and 19/100,000 for females.\n\nCommon Locations: Bronchogenic cancers arise most often as a hilar mass but may also present as a large peripheral mass.\n\nGross Appearance: The neoplastic tissue is typically gray-white and firm to hard.  Bulky tumors often have areas of necrosis that appear yellow-white and mottling. \n\nHistology: Histology varies depending on the subtype: adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype and features include gland formation, mucin production, and often an adjacent desmoplastic response.  Other subtypes include squamous cell carcinomas, small cell carcinomas, and large cell carcinomas.\n\nSpecial Stains: Mucicarmine, Cytokeratin 7, Cytokeratin 20, and TTF -1.\n\nRadiology: Plain chest films may show single or multiple nodules, well defined or poorly defined masses in the hilar or peripheral regions or no findings. Mediastinal enlargement may be evident due to primary tumor or metastatic lymphadenopathy.  CT may show an irregular or spiculated edge due to fibrosis surrounding the tumor, a lobulated contour, air bronchograms within the nodule, or cavitation. 95% of lung nodules exceeding 2 cm are cancers. \nOf particular significance for this case is the radiologic appearance of lung cancer metastases to the liver. A liver met will typically appear as a well-defined, low-density, solid mass with vague peripheral enhancement.  The mass will often appear hypodense centrally due to tumor necrosis.  Calcifications may be present. Multiple masses or diffusely infiltrating metastases may also occur.   \n\nProgression: Bronchogenic CA spreads by direct invasion or via the hematogeneous or lympahngitic routes.  Mediastinal nodes are commonly involved, and distal mets to the liver, brain, bone, and adrenals are common.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: Overall prognosis is approximately 9% 5 year survival. Small-cell carcinoma has a median survival rate of 12-18 months and is treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Non-small cell cancers are treated surgically if disease is limited. Chemotherapy and radiation may be used in advanced disease.", "keywords": "Lung CA", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2071_synpic16474", "MPX2071_synpic16475"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2071_synpic16474", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2071_synpic16474.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Metastatic lesion in liver.

In medical terminology, coarctation refers to a localized narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow.   Coarctation of the aorta typically occurs in the \"juxta-ductal\" part of the aorta, or the part near where the ductus arteriosus attaches near the aortic isthmus. Depending on the exact location of the constriction of the aorta, it can be classified as either preductal / isthmic (infantile) coarctation or postductal / juxtaductal (adult type) coarctation. The most frequently encountered type is the postductal / juxtaductal variety.  In the postductal type, the area of the coarctation is located at, or just distal to, the level of the left subclavian artery and ductus arteriosus and usually is short and discrete. In the rarer second type, (preductal, isthmic, or infantile) the area of narrowing usually lies proximal to the ductus arteriosus, somewhere between the left subclavian artery and the left carotid artery. Preductal coarctation is associated with an increased incidence of cardiac defects, and as preductal coarctations do not significantly alter normal fetal blood flow patterns, no collaterals form in utero hence they are typically not seen later in life. Several surgical methods of repair are employed, including end-to-end reanastomosis, subclavian flap aortoplasty, prosthetic patch onlay grafts, and interposition grafts.    Usually, the presence of coarctation alone is indication for an operation. Several techniques are currently used to repair coarctation of the aorta and the method of repair employed is usually tailored specifically to each patient.  Follow-up for these patients depends upon the clinical response to the intervention. The most common complications after coarctation repair are late restenosis and aneurysm formation at the repair site. One of the most common methods of repair of coarctation of the aorta is resection of the involved segment with end-to-end reanastomosis.  Some of the benefits of this particular technique include avoidance of prosthetic materials, excision of ductal tissue, preservation of the left subclavian artery, and relief of left ventricular outflow obstruction.  The current trend in management is to attempt a corrective surgery in neonates and to try transcatheter balloon dilation before surgery in older children and adults. Recently, treatment of aortic coarctation by percutatious catheter interventions has become more widespread, using both balloon dilation and primary stent implantation techniques. These techniques were first regarded mainly as a procedure for the treatment of recurrent coarctation. However, they have gained more widespread acceptance as a procedure for both the unoperated lesions and the recurrent coarctation / restenosis at the site of the procedure. Restenosis is a common complication and is often associated with post stenotic aneurismal dilatation. Follow-up imaging to assess for post surgical success and assessment of potential late complications can be accomplished using various modalities.  Adequate visualization of the entire arch is needed.  Angiography remain the gold standard, however noninvasive imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is becoming more popular.", "keywords": "coarctation", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1677_synpic21841", "MPX1677_synpic21842", "MPX1677_synpic21843", "MPX1677_synpic21844", "MPX1677_synpic21845", "MPX1677_synpic21866", "MPX1677_synpic22032"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1677_synpic21841", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1677_synpic21841.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MRA - MR Angiography/Venography", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Just proximal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery is a significant web across the lumen of the aortic.

This disease is endemic to 74 countries to include Central and South America, Egypt and other African nations, the Middle East, Asia (particularly rural areas in China), and India.  The infection is brought to the United States by immigrants and travelers returning from endemic areas.  \n\nThe main species of blood flukes or Schistosomes to infect humans are S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi, and S. haematobium.  The first three species characteristically affect the gastrointestinal tract (inhabiting the portal veins) and the latter typically affects the urinary tract (inhabit veins of bladder) and is the most common cause of bladder calcification in the world.  The incidence in males is nine times greater than in females.  Risk factors include but are not limited to extreme poverty, lack of public health facilities, and poor sanitary conditions.  Infection most commonly occurs in adults who live in rural areas and/or who work in either the agricultural or freshwater fishing fields.\n\nRoute of Infection: Schistosomiasis is a chronic infection caused by parasitic trematode worms that currently affects 200 million people in subtropical and tropical environments and is not an insignificant threat to deployed military members. Schistosomiasis infection in humans begins with cercariae penetration of the skin or buccal mucosal from a contaminated water source.  Schistosome ova are subsequently deposited within the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract and a granulomatous and fibrotic reaction ensues, resulting in a multisystemic and often nonspecific clinical manifestations.  Schistosomiasis is major cause of portal hypertension worldwide and can potentially result in permanent gastrointestinal and urinary system damage if not appropriately treated. \n\nClinical:  Clinical manifestations can be separated into three different phases: acute, chronic, and severe.  Also known as Katayama fever, the acute phase is usually found in children or young adults who have not had any prior exposure to Schistosomes.  Believed to be the result of high antigen exposure, this early phase is more commonly associated with S. japonicum infections.  Clinical manifestations of this early phase include: dermatitis, bronchospasm, fever, malaise, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia; amongst other nonspecific complaints.  The chronic phase, which is usually subclinical, is characterized clinically by diarrhea and fevers.  There may be related growth rate depression, hepato- and/or splenomegaly, and complications of hepatic fibrosis (i.e. portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, varices of the esophagus and related hemetemesis).  \n\nThe most frequent cause of death in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is gastrointestinal bleeding.  Bladder fibrosis may contribute to ureteral obstruction, pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis which can lead to renal failure.  Bladder infection has been linked with the development of bladder carcinoma.  The severe phase of disease, unlike the chronic phase, is typically symptomatic.   \n\nThe Schistosome has a complex life cycle: humans are infected through contact with contaminated fresh water.  The pathophysiology of gastrointestinal calcification is related to the Schistosome fluke eggs deposited in tissues and not caused by the flukes themselves.  Following deposition of these Schistoma fluke eggs within the venules of the urinary tract (most commonly the bladder and distal ureters), and gastrointestinal tract lumen, there is development of a hypersensitivity or granulomatous reaction and fibrosis around the Schistosome eggs.  The severity or degree of calcification correlates with the number of eggs deposited.  Many of the eggs are swept back into the liver, where they become lodged within the parenchyma and result in hepatic calcification, fibrosis and associated portal hypertension.   \n\nClinical manifestations can be separated into three different phases: acute, chronic, and severe.  Also known as Katayama fever, the acute phase is usually found in children or young adults who have not had any prior exposure to Schistosomes.  Believed to be the result of high antigen exposure, this early phase is more commonly associated with S. japonicum infections.  Clinical manifestations of this early phase include: dermatitis, bronchospasm, fever, malaise, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia; amongst other nonspecific complaints.  The chronic phase, which is usually subclinical, is characterized clinically by diarrhea and fevers.  There may be related growth rate depression, hepato- and/or splenomegaly, and complications of hepatic fibrosis (i.e. portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, varices of the esophagus and related hemetemesis).  \n\nThe most frequent cause of death in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is gastrointestinal bleeding.  Bladder fibrosis may contribute to ureteral obstruction, pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis which can lead to renal failure.  Bladder infection has been linked with the development of bladder carcinoma.  The severe phase of disease, unlike the chronic phase, is typically symptomatic.   \n\nThe diagnosis can be readily made through the identification of eggs in stool in S. japonicum and S. mansoni infection or by detecting eggs in urine in S. haematobium infection.   Other more aggressive means of definitive diagnosis include liver, rectal, or bladder biopsy.  Additonal nonaggressive yet relatively sensitive diagnostic tests include oval precipitaiton testing and an intradermal immunological skin test for the Schistosome antigen.  \n\nImaging can play a role in demonstrating the extent of organ involvement and complications of Schistosomiasis infection.  Conventional radiography may be the initial means of detecting calcification of the bladder or distal ureters (parallel linear radiodense appearance).  Intravenous pyleogram (IVP) or cystography in particular are very good studies for demonstrating ureteritis cystica, ureteral stricture (or dilation), hydronephrosis, mucosal irregularity, urolithiasis, decreased bladder capacity, bladder tumor, and inflammatory pseudoployps.  CT is useful and more sensitive than radiography for the detection and characterization of urolithiasis and pyelonephritis.  \n\nNodular hepatic lesions have been demonstrated sonographically and by CT in acute Schistosomiasis.  In the colon, extensive curvilinear or tram-track calcifications have been identified in patients with schistosomiasis japonica. Another study involving intravenous contrast-enhanced CT in Schistosomiasis japonica hepatic infection, showed septal, amorphous, and capsular contrast enhancement patterns.  This study concluded that septal enhancement may suggest the diagnosis of hepatic schistosomiasis japonica, particularly when calcification is not identified on noncontrast CT study.  The most reliable diagnostic techniques for detecting chronic bladder disease are cystoscopy, serology, CT and to a lesser extent urography.  Urinalysis in chronic disease may result in missed detection of disease that would otherwise be identified during the early phase of disease.  \n\nhttp://tmcr.usuhs.mil/tmcr/chapter2/intro.htm", "keywords": "SchistosomiasisJaponicumParasites", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1706_synpic30077", "MPX1706_synpic30080"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1706_synpic30077", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1706_synpic30077.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Axial intravenous contast-enhanced CT image at the level of the lower abdomen", "age": "51", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.1", "figure_part": "2a"}, {"image_id": "MPX1706_synpic30080", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1706_synpic30080.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Axial intravenous contrast-enhanced CT image through the pelvis", "age": "51", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.1", "figure_part": "3a"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nA 51-year-old woman presents with chronic left flank and pelvic pain.

Ninety per cent occur in children less than 7 years of age, with a median age of 3-1/2 years.  The children are usually asymptomatic, most often presenting with clinical suspicion of an abdominal mass (approximately 70%).  Other symptoms include abdominal pain (30%), hematuria (15 to 20%), and less commonly with moderately severe hypertension and nonspecific constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise, gastrointestinal complaints).  There is a higher incidence of Wilms' tumor in patients with certain congenital abnormalities such as aniridia, hemi-hypertrophy, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, nephroblastomatosis, and various genitourinary abnormalities (hypoplasia, fusion, ectopia, duplicated collecting systems, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism).\n\nWilms' tumor is secondary to proliferation of metanephric blastema.  It is typically bulky and usually extends within the renal parenchyma, displacing and distorting the pelvocalyceal system.  However, the mass may be exophytic or may, although rarely, be extrarenal.  The outcome following multimodal therapy depends on the initial stage and whether or not the tumor has favorable or unfavorable histology for response to treatment.  The unfavorable types include anaplastic, sarcomatous, and rhabdoid types.\n\nThe following stages have been described for Wilms' tumor:\n\nI:  Tumor limited to kidney and completely resected, negative margins, intact renal capsule, not rupture.\n\nII:  Tumor extends beyond kidney, but completely excised, negative margins, regional infiltration, spillage.\n\nIII:  Residual nonhematogenous tumor, confined to abdomen including lymph nodes, peritoneal implants, incomplete excision.\n\nIV:  Hematogenous metastases beyond stage III, i.e., lung, liver, bone, brain.\n\nV:  Bilateral renal involvement, at time of diagnosis.\n\nWilms' tumor is bilateral (Stage V) in 5 to 10% at time of initial diagnosis.  In a patient with unilateral Wilms', a contralateral tumor may develop 5 to 10 years later, although the majority occur within 2 years.  The work-up should include a plain abdominal supine radiograph, not only to look for mass affect but also to look for calcifications, skeletal abnormalities, and paravertebral masses which may help in differentiating Wilms' tumor from neuroblastoma. \n\nThe next imaging study should be abdominal and pelvic sonography to determine the organ of origin, the size and extent of the mass, the characteristics of the mass (solid, cystic, complex calcifications), the presence of regional lymphadenopathy, liver metastases, tumor thrombus in the renal vein, inferior vena cava, and/or right atrium, and to look for bilaterality of the mass.  One should also look for any evidence of nephroblastomatosis which appears sonographically as hypoechoic masses in the periphery of the kidney, thickening of the renal capsule, or as nodularity or lobulation of the kidney.  This entity, which may be an anlage for Wilms' tumor, is much more easily seen with contrast- enhanced CT.  Duplex and/or color Doppler imaging are particularly helpful in the evaluation of the venous vasculature structures that may be involved with Wilms' tumor.  Wilms' tumor is most often a solid mass, although cystic spaces may often be seen within the mass due to internal hemorrhage and/or necrosis.  We have noted that some of the cystic spaces within Wilms' tumor are large venous channels due to arteriovenous shunting.\n\nDepending upon the sophistication of the ultrasound, one may choose to also obtain a baseline CT, unless nephroblastomatosis is suspected.  Certainly a baseline chest CT is recommended prior to surgery to look for pulmonary metastases.

Fibrous or calcific thickening of the pericardium may lead to constrictive pericardial disease due to restriction of cardiac motion which chronically compromises ventricular filling.  Onset of constrictive pericarditis is usually between the ages of 30-50 years and prevalence is three times greater in males than in females.  An associated protein losing enteropathy may be present.  The most common cause of constrictive pericardial disease is postpericardiotomy and hemopericardium for any reason.  The second most common cause is radiation therapy, but Coxsackie B virus, TB, uremia, connective tissue disease, neoplasm, and idiopathic etiologies may be seen.  \n\nPatients with constrictive pericarditis commonly present with symptoms of heart failure to include dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigability.  They may occasionally present with liver enlargement, ascites and later on with cirrhosis (\"cardiac cirrhosis\")secondary to chronic hepatic congestion.\n\nNormal pericardial thickness is less than 2mm.  When greater than 4mm and accompanied by clinical findings of heart failure, constrictive pericarditis is highly likely.  It is essential to realize, however, that neither pericardial thickening nor calcification is pathognomonic of constrictive pericarditis unless the patient also has concomitant symptoms of physiologic constriction.  However, 50% of patients with pericardial calcifications have constrictive pericarditis.  Pericardial thickening may be global or limited to the right side of the heart or to the right AV groove.\n\nCalcifications are seen on plain film radiography in up to 50% of patients.  Ascites and plural effusions are common.  Normal to mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is commonly seen along with small atria, dilated superior and inferior vena cava and azygos vein, and flat or straitened right heart border.\n\nEchocardiography may show thickened pericardium, abnormal septal motion, and increased left ventricular ejection fraction with a small end-diastolic volume. \n\nCT and MR imaging are excellent in depicting the pericardium, and in aiding the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, especially in difficult cases.  CT is particularly good for demonstrating pericardial thickening and calcification.  Reflux of contrast into the coronary sinus, a bowed interventricular septum, flattening of the right ventricle, ascites, and pleural effusions, may all be seen.  Both CT and MR show pericardial thickening, dilatation of the right atrium, inferior vena cava and hepatic veins along with a sigmoid septal shift (or prominent leftward septal convexity) and narrowing/reduced volume of the right ventricle.  MR may demonstrate abnormal flow mechanics in the vena cava and atria.\n\nFrom the clinical standpoint it is important to differentiate constrictive pericarditis from other restrictive myocardial diseases ( Myocarditis)since both entities have identical pathophysiologic findings on echocardiography or card cath.

The sulcus is typically less than 2mm in depth and is more conspicuous than the medial sulcus due to its parallel alignment with the x-ray. The depth of the lateral sulcus can be measured by drawing a line tangential to the sulcus on the articular surface.  The “lateral femoral notch sign” is a result of anterior subluxation of the tibia with impaction of the lateral femoral condyle on the posterolateral tibial plateau.  This pattern of injury is described as “kissing contusions”.  \n\nThe finding of a deep lateral femoral notch has been associated with anterior cruciate ligament tears.

Often there is a central scar, but there is an absence of hemorrhage and necrosis.\n\nRadiologically these tumors are evaluated the same way as renal cell.  On ultrasound the oncocytoma is indistinguishable from renal cell.  Typical features on CT include a central, stellate pattern with low attentuation.  Additionally the tumor appears very homogenous.  With angiography oncocytomas have four typical signs: lucent rim, homogenous capillary nephrogram phase, absence of neoplastic vessels, and feeding arteries with a spoked wheel appearance.  While these have been used as predictors of oncocytoma, they have shown poor predictive value in differentiating oncocytoms from renal cell.  MRI is currently being evaluated for its ability to diagnose oncocytoma.  Characteristics indicative of this tumor on MR include low intensity homogenous mass on T1 that shows increased intensity on T2 with a capsule, central scar or stellate pattern and no hemorrhage or necrosis. \n\nOncocytomas are very difficult to differentiate from renal cell carcinoma both clincally and radiologically and the use of renal biposy is not recommended due to the similar histological appearance of the two entities in certain situations.

It is thought that this slow growing tumor (suspected meningioma) was responsible for this patient's loss of consciousness and subsequent motor vehicle accident.", "topic_title": "Suspected meningioma", "acr_code": "1.3", "category": "Neoplasm, non-glial", "disease_discussion": "Meningiomas originate from arachnoid cap cells and are the most common extraaxial neoplasms of the brain, representing 15-20% of all brain tumors.  Although it is hormonally sensitive and is three times more common in women, meningioma represents a significant proportion of the extraaxial neoplasms in men and in adults of all age groups.  Most patients present between the ages of 40 and 60 years of age.  Meningiomas are uncommon in children without associated neurofibromatosis type-2.  The most common locations for meningiomas (in descending order) are the parasagital dura, convexities, sphenoid wing, juxtasellar, cerebellopontine angle cistern, olfactory groove, posterior fossa clivus, planum sphenoidale, and tentorium.  Uncommon locations are the ventricles (pediatric patients), with a distinct propensity for the left lateral ventricle, and the optic nerve sheath (adult females).  2-3% occur in the spine.  Less than one percent of meningiomas are extradural and result from embryologic arachnoid rests outside the CNS.  These extradural menigiomas have been found in the interdiploic space, outer table of skull, skin, paranasal sinuses, parotid gland, and parapharyngeal space.  Multiple lesions occur in 1-2% of patients increasing to 30% with a previous history of radiation therapy.\n\nMeningiomas often incite a variable amount of intracranial edema with lesions adjacent to the cerebral cortex tending to cause greater edema than those along the basal cisterns or planum.  However, edema is absent in 40% of cases because of slow growth. The lesions themselves demonstrate calcifications in 20% of cases while cystic areas are seen 15% of the time.  Meningiomas can sometimes demonstrate intraosseous extension or grow through the bone or into the dura.  Hyperostosis or osteolysis occur in 20% to 46% of cases.  Hyperostosis is particularly common when the tumor is at the skull base or anterior cranial fossa where it may resemble fibrous dysplasia or Paget’s disease.  The skull base is the one region where meningiomas can become unresectable because of collateral damage to vital structures.  Occasionally, meningiomas may have necrotic centers.  Thrombosis and, rarely, osteblastic, chondromatous, or fatty degeneration occurs.  Meningiomas may encase and narrow adjacent vessels.  Meningiomas often parasitize pial vessels.  As such, these lesions have both a dural and a pial blood supply.  In the typical convexity or sphenoid wing meningioma, the middle meningeal artery is enlarged.\n\nAtypical meningiomas make up 2.4% of all meningiomas and are classified as WHO grade II.  Atypical lesions must exhibit increased mitotic rates, small cells with high nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio, prominent nucleoli, sheet like growth, and foci of necrosis causing nonhomogenous enhancement.  They look like benign meningiomas radiographically, but recur more frequently.  Hemorrhage is common as are peripheral low density zones from trapped CSF in arachnoid cysts.\n\nMelignant meningiomas are classified as WHO grade III, are uncommon and are usually diagnosed when intraparenchymal invasion, markedly rapid growth, or sarcomatous degeneration has taken place, most likely arising from benign tumors gone awry.  The papillary variety of meningioma undergoes malignant differentiation more commonly than the rest.  Higher grade is associated with a higher rate of recurrence.  Survival varies with the site, size, grade, and extent of surgical removal of tumor.\n\nRadiation therapy induces five times more meningiomas than it does schwannomas or sarcomas.  Diagnosis of radiation induced meningioma is made if the meningioma arises in the radiation field, appears after a latency period (of years), was not the primary tumor irradiated, and is not seen in a patient with neurofibromatosis.  Low dose radiation treatment for tinea capitis has been associated with meningiomas following a latency period of about 35 years.  Recurrence rates are higher in radiation-induced meningiomas than in non-radiation induced tumors.\n\nOn unenhanced CT scan, 75% of meningiomas are slightly hyperdense while 25% are isodense to normal brain parenchyma.  Strong, homogenous enhancement is a hallmark (90%).  Signal intensity is similar to normal falx on enhanced and nonenhanced CT.  Calcifications are seen in 20% of lesions and cystic areas are present in 15% of tumors.  The tumors appear round and unilobulated with sharp margins.  A lobulated, extraaxial, parasagittal mass with a dural tail is a typical finding on CT scan.  Rarely, they may appear en plaque, with pancake-like spread along the dura.  Extension of tumor or dural reaction along a dural surface is not uncommon and is known as a “dural tail” which is suggestive, but not specific for meningioma.  Bony erosions are rare, but are more common with malignant meningiomas, where as hyperostosis is more common and more often associated with benign nature.\n\nTumors are typically isointense to gray matter on MRI with strong gadolinium enhancement.  MRI is the best technique for detecting the dural tail.  Increased vascular flow voids within and around the lesion are characteristic.\n\nAngiographic characteristics include a spoke-wheel appearance with dense venous filling, a persistent tumor blush (“comes early and stays late”) with well demarcated margins and a dural vascular supply.

This particular patient is scheduled to undergo surgery.", "discussion": "The open skull defect with protruding mass narrows the ddx to encephalocele and meningocele.  Since both CSF and brain parenchyma are noted protruding from the skull defect, the dx is encephalocele.", "topic_title": "Fronto-nasal encephalocele", "acr_code": "1.1", "category": "Congenital, malformation", "disease_discussion": "The term cephalocele refers to a defect in the skull and dura with extracranial extension of intracranial structures.  The term encephalocele refers to herniation of both brain tissue and meninges through the skull defect, whereas the term meningocele refers to herniation of the meninges only.  Both the skull defect and herniation are more common in the midline.  \n\nMost encephaloceles are easily recognized by the clinician.  On initial examination, the patient has a large midline extracranial mass that is soft to palpation.  In patients with obvious masses such as these, the imaging study is obtained to look for associated brain anomalies that may alter the child's prognosis.  An example of such an associated anomaly is shown in Films .3 - .6.  This patient with a large frontal encephalocele also has agenesis of the corpus callosum and multiple gray matter heterotopias in the subependymal region.  The absence of the corpus callosum can be detected on both the sagittal images by the absence of the corpus on the midline image and on the axial images by the characteristic shape of the frontal horns and the parallel lateral ventricles.\n\nAnother reason to obtain imaging studies in patients with encephaloceles is to look for the location of the major vascular structures of the brain.  Particularly, because most encephaloceles are in the midline, the torcula and the superior sagittal sinus are crucial structures that must be located.  In Films .7 - .9, a parietal encephalocele is shown.  This case has two very important findings.  The first is the deformity of the brain in the region of the encephalocele.  Notice how the midbrain and cerebellum are stretched toward the calvarial defect.  This stretching results from the pulsations of the brain causing it to be pushed out of the calvarial defect.  The immature brain (before myelination) is very soft and easily deformed.  Therefore it can be molded into just about any shape.  It is common to see this sort of stretching of brain toward the skull defect in patients with encephaloceles.  The other important feature of this case is the position of the superior sagittal sinus.  On sequential coronal films, going from front to back, the sagittal sinus can be visualized in its entirety in relation to the encephalocele.  Arrows point to the sinus as it courses within the most inferior and lateral aspect of the sac on the right.  Notice that the sinus would be outside of the calvarium if the calvarium were present.  More posteriorly, the torcula is high and the straight sinuses are seen to course steeply inferiorly within the walls of the tentorium cerebellum (arrows).  The steep leaves of the tentorium probably result from the same process that causes herniation of the midbrain and cerebellum into the calvarial defect.  \n\nSpecial mention should be made of sphenoidal and fronto-nasal encephaloceles because they are often clinically occult at birth.  A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of encephalocele in adolescents and young adults who present with nasal or nasopharyngeal masses.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1171_synpic26485", "MPX1171_synpic26486", "MPX1171_synpic26487", "MPX1171_synpic26497", "MPX1171_synpic26498"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1171_synpic26485", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1171_synpic26485.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Generalized", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1 sagittal view showing enlarged posterior lateral ventricle.

The sutures are dynamic: as the brain grows, the sutures expand, adding new bone.  An infant’s brain grows rapidly, doubling in 6 months and again in 2 years.  If the sutures are compressed, either mechanically or due to failure of underlying CNS expansion, the sutures may either resorb or fuse.  Underlying brain growth causes increased growth parallel to the suture, resulting in characteristic head shapes.  Synostoses can be primary (fusion of single suture as an isolated event) or secondary, often associated with several syndromes. The prevalence of primary synostosis is about 1/4000 to 1/1000 live births. An inherited tendency or family history has been reported in many cases in the literature, however, most cases of isolated craniosynostosis are usually sporadic in occurrence with no known etiology.\n\nTrue craniosynostosis will not improve with time and usually worsens with growth.\n\nDiagnosis is made on the basis of characteristic head shape, presence of ridges overlying fused sutures, and rotation of facial landmarks. Radiologic studies are discussed below.\n\nClinically, signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may also be present (vomiting, lethargy). Some synostoses are diagnosed in the context of syndromes (discussed below). \nA quick basic anatomy review is helpful before naming the synostoses. The bones of the calvarium are divided by sutures The metopic suture divides the frontal bones. The frontal bones are separated from the parietal bones by the coronal suture, and the two parietal bones are separated from each other by the sagittal suture. The occipital bone is separated from the parietal bones by the lambdoidal sutures. The space where the metopic, coronal and sagittal sutures come together is the anterior fontanel, and the posterior fontanel is present where the lambdoidal and sagittal sutures meet.\n\nCranial synostoses definitions are as follows:\nSagittal craniosynostosis results in scaphocephaly (keel/boat skull).\nMetopic craniosynostosis results in trigonocephaly (triangular skull).\nLambdoidal synostosis results in plagiocephaly (asymmetric skull).\nCoronal synostosis results in brachycephaly (short skull) if bilateral and frontal plagiocephaly if unilateral with ipsilateral eyebrow elevation giving the classic “harlequin eye” appearance.\nBetween 10-20% of synostoses are associated with syndromes. Most of these syndromes are sporadic in occurrence. However, if one parent and one sib are affected, subsequent siblings have about 50% risk of having the syndrome. The most common is Crouzon syndrome involving the sagittal and coronal sutures with shallow orbits, proptosis, hypertelorism and sometimes hydrocephalus. \n\nApert Syndrome involve the coronal, sagittal and lambdoidal sutures with facial dysmorpism, syndactyly and cardiac defects.  Other rarer syndromes include Carpenter’s, Pfeiffer’s and Conrad’s syndromes.\n\nRadiologic workup should center around CT. CT remains the most sensitive barometer of bony fusion. Plain films of the skull may appear normal.  Bone windows and thin slices are necessary with conventional axial CT slices. 3-D CT has simplified the diagnosis and has been show in studies to increase sensitivity. Three-dimensional CT scan processing by shaded-surface reconstruction, volumetric, and depth-coded methods have been shown to be superior to conventional plain radiographs and CT scans in diagnosing craniosynostosis.  The skull base and brain may show underlying abnormalities in the syndromic craniosynostoses. If the patient has increased intercranial pressure, calvarial table resorbtion has been seen with unknown clinical significance.\n\nMost patients with simple craniosynostosis have no neurological compromise, therefore corrective surgery is cosmetic. If the child is 18 months and the deformity is mild, it will not likely worsen and surgery can be avoided.  Conservative therapy involves positional therapy (head position while sleeping and controversial helmet therapy).\n\nSurgical correction is often done for psychosocial reasons with good results. Timing of surgical reconstruction is also controversial with some advocating early intervention (3-4 mos) and others recommend waiting until 8-10mos for better long-term results with less morbidity.  Most craniosynostoses today can be treated with a single surgery with excellent cosmetic results and minimal morbidity and nearly nonexistent mortality.", "keywords": "Cranial Synostosiscranial Stenosisplagiocephaly", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1357_synpic17883"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1357_synpic17883", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1357_synpic17883.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Axial CT bone window showing right displacement of the lambdoid suture and absent right coronal suture.", "age": "5", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.1", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n5 y/o former 24 wk prematue infant with 5 mo NICU with multiple medical problems including history of IVH, CP, MR, congenital cardiac defects including PDA and ASD, and 47 XXY.

Onyx is a relatively new material composed of an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, DMSO, and tantalum.  Tantalum provides the radio-opaque property for intraoperative visualization and accounts for the appearance on this patients chest radiograph.\n\nRelatively little formal analysis of the efficacy and safety of the use of Onyx in the treatment intracerebral AVM's has been conducted.  A study by Van Rooij et al, revealed an average of 75% reduction in the volume of AVM's with a complication rate of 13.6%.  Jahan et al reported similar numbers of 63% and 26%, respectively.  While post-embolization headaches were reported, the majority of collected and reported problems involved hemorrhagic complications.  Such complications are postulated to be secondary to physiologic changes in the regional cerebral blood flow surrounding the perinidal tissues.  Proposed solutions to such complications include possible staged emobolization procedures such to produce less-drastic changes in flow dynamics.\n\nWhile no instances of symptomatic pulmonary embolism(PE) were reported in these investigations, symptomatic pulmonary embolism is a serious potential consequence of accidental peripheral emobolization.  As in this patient’s case, the risk of symptomatic PE is likely lower if only small volumes of the embolic agent migrate to the pulmonary vasculature.

It is just posterior to the pineal gland, in the quadrigeminal plate cistern. This vein probably arises from remnants of the posterior median prosencephalic vein of Markowski.\n\nBy tradition, an aneurysmal enlargement of a midline venous structure in this location has been called a \"Vein of Galen Aneurysm\". However, the true origin of this dilated vascular structure is probably persistence of the anterior portion of the median prosencephalic vein (ProsV) of Markowski.  In many patients with this malformation, there is no \"classic\" vein of Galen; and, often, there is no straight sinus.  Instead, the dilated remnant of the ProsV drains into upward directed \"falcine sinus\".\n\nThese lesions most often result from vascular shunts developing between the early choroidal arteries and the deep or midline veins, during the  6th to 11th week of gestation. At this time in development, the brain is primarily supplied by multiple choroidal arteries, then - later - the circle of Willis.\n\nThese AV shunts persist, preventing involution of the anterior prosencephalic vein.  A persistent falcine vein is often present, that drains the ProsV into the straight sinus or superior sagittal sinus.\n\nVein Of Galen Malformation Symptoms, Signs\n•  Childhood\n» High Output Failure\n» Persistent Ductus \n» Hydrocephalus\n» Cranial Bruit/Thrill\n•  Adult\n» Asymptomatic \n» Pineal Symptoms\n \n \n•  Vein Of Galen Malformation Types/Causes\n» Parenchymal AVM (Shunt)\n» Direct Fistulae To VOG\n» Dural Fistula Draining into VOG\n» Sinus Thrombosis (Intrauterine)\n» Hypoplastic Straight Sinus\n \n \n•  Hydrocephalus is very common in childhood\n» Mechanical\n  - Aqueductal Obstruction from compression of tectum\n» Impaired CSF Resorption\n  - Venous Hypertension\n \n\nUoR Teaching File - http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/smd/Rad/neurocases/Neurocase06.htm", "keywords": "pineal regionmedian prosencephalic vein of Markowskivein of Galen Aneurysm", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2347_synpic39279"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2347_synpic39275", "MPX2347_synpic39276", "MPX2347_synpic39277", "MPX2347_synpic39714", "MPX2347_synpic39715", "MPX2347_synpic39716", "MPX2347_synpic39717", "MPX2347_synpic39718", "MPX2347_synpic39719", "MPX2347_synpic39720"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2347_synpic39279", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2347_synpic39279.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "CT following embolization demonstrates Onyx material with significant beam-hardening artifact in the previous location of the malformation.

Symptoms initially are vague including abdominal pain, weight loss, occult fecal blood (50%) and jaundice (33% of duodenal tumors). 1/2 to 2/3 of cases are discovered late in their course at emergency laparotomy for obstructive symptoms. The most common location for adenocarcinoma to occur is in the duodenum. \nBarium studies and CT can both be helpful for detecting small bowel adenocarcinoma. Small bowel follow-through sensitivity is 50-80 percent.  Enteroclysis has higher sensitivity, but requires greater technical skill.\nOn CT the tumor typically appears as focal bowel wall nodular thickening and may have a soft tissue mass extending into the mesentery. CT can be helpful for evaluating the extent of extraluminal disease, including local extension, lymph nodes and distant metastasis. \n5-year survival after diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is 20-30%.", "keywords": "small boweladenocarcinoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1971_synpic16543"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1971_synpic16543", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1971_synpic16543.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "The mass involves the small bowel wall and extends into adjacent mesentery.", "age": "0", "sex": "N/A", "acr_codes": "7.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nN/A\n\nPhysical Exam:\nUnknown\n\nImaging Findings:\nMass involving the small bowel wall (probably jejunum) and extending into the mesentery.

They are benign neoplasms of endothelial origin; most commonly seen in young and middle aged adults.  They are the most common primary cerebellar neoplasm in adults 40-60 years old.  Among patients with hemangioblastoma, 25 percent occur in those with von Hippel-Lindau disease. On the other hand, hemangioblastomas are the most common lesions associated with VHL disease, eventually affecting 44 to 80 percent of patients. Sporadic hemangioblastoma are usually solitary; multiple tumors within the neuraxis should raise suspicion for VHL disease.\nHemangioblastomas cause neurologic deficits, both by direct compression or tumor-associated hemorrhage. The specific deficit from direct compression depends upon tumor location, and may include cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor nerve dysfunction, motor weakness, or sensory deficits. Patients with spinal hemangioblastomas frequently present with pain.  Secondary to this associated risk of hemorrhage, surgical treatment is indicated, as in this patient.\n\nThe diagnostic procedure of choice is gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The classic appearance is a well-defined cystic mass with an intensely enhancing mural nodule (60% of cases).  Because the tumor nodule receives it’s blood supply from the pia mater, the nodule, which represents the tumor itself, is almost always superficial.  Up to 40% are entirely solid.  In these cases, the margins can be ill-defined and occasionally can see hemorrhage.  Surrounding edema may be present.  Flow voids within the nodule may be present.\n\nAn acute hemorrhage secondary to hemangioblastoma can be catastrophic.  Intracerebral bleeding from a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may cause rapid obstructive hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, brainstem compression, or uncal herniation. Bleeding from a spinal hemangioblastoma may result in acute quadriplegia or paraplegia from hemorrhage into the spinal cord.  Headache, back pain, or radiculopathy can result from subarachnoid hemorrhage. In these situations, emergency neurosurgical intervention is indicated.\n\nReferences:\nBrant WE, Helms CA.

They are not malformations.  They account for less than 3% of all intracranial neoplasms (1).  These tumors are most common  in  young  and middle-aged  adults,  where the incidence in males exceeds that of females (2).  The cerebellar hemisphere is the most common location, although they may be located in  the  spinal  cord,  brain stem,  or cerebral  hemispheres.    Ten percent of hemangioblastomas occur as part of the von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n\nSixty percent of these tumors are cystic, as in this case.  The enhancing mural nodule is a common finding in hemangioblastoma.  At CT,  the  cystic  portion of the tumor appears low density and does not enhance, while the  mural  nodule  enhances  homogeneously  and intensely.  The  MR  findings,  as  seen  in this case, include a predominantly cystic tumor with long  T1  and  long  T2  relaxation times,  and  intense enhancement of the peripheral nodule following gadolinium administration.  If the vascular nodule has bled  or  is proteinaceous,  it  may  be  hyperintense  on  short TR precontrast sequences.  More than one  enhancing  tumor  nodule  may  be  seen. Forty  percent  of hemangioblastomas are solid and display variable degrees of contrast enhancement.\n\nLateral  projections of a left vertebral artery subtraction angiogram (arterial and venous phases) in another patient with hemangioblastoma are shown in Films .6 and .7.  The angiographic findings are characteristic for a hemangioblastoma.  Notice the focal  enhancing nodule  fed  predominantly  by  the  superior cerebellar artery and seen densely enhancing in the arterial phase.   Because of  significant  artifact  in  the  posterior  fossa on CT, a small peripheral nodule may be missed and angiography is felt to be more sensitive  than  contrast  CT scan for detecting nodules.  MRI with Gd-DTPA may replace angiography for  evaluation  of  patients  with suspected hemangioblastoma.\n\nvon  Hippel-Lindau  disease  is  an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete and variable penetrance (3).  The incidence is equal in males and females.  Multiple lesions have been reported in  this syndrome,  but  the  most important lesions which cause significant morbidity include retinal angiomatosis, cerebellar or  spinal  cord hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.  Over  50% of patients with this syndrome have hemangioblastomas of the retina, which may present with acute or  chronic  retinal  detachment.  Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals these lesions, and radiographic evaluation plays a small role.\n\nThirty-six  to sixty percent of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have cerebellar hemangioblastoma.  Signs and symptoms due  to  this tumor  are  the  most common cause for patients to present with the syndrome.\n\nAlthough  the reported occurrence of spinal cord hemangioblastoma is 5%, autopsy data  and  MRI  suggest  the  incidence  may  be higher (4,5).    Signs and symptoms of a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may be dramatic, and neurologic deficit from a spinal  cord  lesion may  be overlooked.  Typical MR findings in a spinal cord hemangioblastoma include syringomyelia,  enhancing  nodule,  and  enlarged feeding and draining vessels.  \n\nTwenty-five  to  thirty-eight  percent  of  patients  with  von Hippel-Lindau disease will develop renal cell carcinoma, which may be multiple  and bilateral.   Pheochromocytoma is found in 10% of patients with this disease.\n\nOther  lesions  in  von  Hippel-Lindau  disease include angiomas of the liver and kidney and cysts of  the  pancreas,  liver,  kidney  and epididymis.  \n\nRoutine  screening  of  family  members  of  a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease has been  recommended.    MRI  with  Gd-DTPA  is  the procedure of choice to screen for CNS involvement.\n\nIn  the  adult, the  differential diagnosis for a cystic mass in the posterior fossa includes a simple arachnoid cyst or  a  cerebellar astrocytoma.    A  simple  arachnoid  cyst  is extra- axial and will not demonstrate an enhancing  nodule,  although  such  a  nodule  may  be  seen  in  a cerebellar  astrocytoma.  Since 40% of cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be solid, this lesion should be included in the differential of a solid or partially solid mass  in  the  posterior  fossa  in  the adult.  These lesions   are   uncommon   in   children, and medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or astrocytoma are more likely than a cerebellar hemangioblastoma when a posterior fossa mass is seen in a child.", "keywords": "hemangioblastoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2336_synpic49838"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2336_synpic49839", "MPX2336_synpic49840", "MPX2336_synpic49841"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2336_synpic49838", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2336_synpic49838.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "CT: Well-marginated low-density cystic appearing cerebellar mass with a mural nodule.", "age": "33", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2336_synpic49839", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2336_synpic49839.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1 hypointense cystic cerebellar lesion with isointense mural nodule.", "age": "33", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2336_synpic49840", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2336_synpic49840.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1 hypointense cystic cerebellar lesion with isointense mural nodule", "age": "33", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2336_synpic49841", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2336_synpic49841.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2 hyperintense cystic component with isointence mural nodule.", "age": "33", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n33 y/o man with complaints of nonspecific headaches, without focal neurological finding.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nSubjective headaches, without focal neurological finding on examination.\n\nImaging Findings:\n•  CT: Well-marginated low-density cystic appearing cerebellar mass with a mural nodule. \n\n•  MRI: T1 hypointense / T2 Hyperintense cystic cerebellar lesion with isointense mural nodule.", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

Screening for MCA berry aneurysms.", "discussion": "With routine screening of blood pressure, hypertension has become the leading initial presenting symptom of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.", "topic_title": "Autosomal Dominant \"Adult\" Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)", "acr_code": "8.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "BACKGROUND: \nThe autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an important cause of renal failure, accounting for 10% to 15% of patients who receive hemodialysis. Its incidence is approximately 1 in 500 to 1000, and approximately 500,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease. \n\nTwo genes for ADPKD have been localized, PKD1 on chromosome 16 and PKD2 on chromosome 4. A third but rare genetic locus, PKD3, is thought to exist but has not yet been identified. The trait theoretically has a 100% penetrance, and on average, because it is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, 50% of an affected individual’s offspring will likewise be affected. Ninety-six percent of affected persons will manifest the disease clinically by age 90 years.\n\nETIOLOGY:\nOne theory suggests that a defect in the basement membrane of the tubules accounts for cyst development.  A 2nd theory holds that epithelial hyperplasia is an integral part of cyst formation. A 3rd theory postulates a defect in one of the proteins of the supportive extracellular connective tissue matrix.  A 4th theory involves the location of Na+ -K+ -ATPase in the cystic epitheliumEach theory has supportive findings.  However, it appears that tubular epithelial cell hyperplasia is the major component of cyst development.\n\nGENETICS: \nTwo genes have been identified as the culprits for ADPKD: the polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) gene localized on the short arm of chromosome 16, which accounts for approximately 85% to 90% of cases, and the PKD2 gene localized to chromosome 4, which accounts for approximately 5% to 10% of cases. The presence of a third locus (PKD3) is now accepted as the cause of disease in a very small percentage of patients.   Those with the PKD2 defect usually typically  have a later onset of clinical symptoms and a slower progression of disease. In addition, Bear, et al, suggested that the disease in general is more severe and manifests earlier when it is inherited from the mother rather than from the father.\n\nCLINICAL FEATURES:\nTypically, symptoms or signs first occur between the ages of 30 and 50 years. These include microscopic and gross hematuria, flank pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and renal colic secondary either to clots or stone and hypertension. Microscopic or gross hematuria is seen in 50% of patients, and in 19% to 35% it is the presenting symptom.  However, as blood pressure screening has become more widespread, hypertension more than hematuria has become the principal form of presentation.  In children who present after 1 year of age, the principal signs and symptoms are related to hypertension, proteinuria, and/or hematuria.  Neonates present mostly on the basis of renomegaly. When the disease is severe, stillbirth or significant respiratory distress can occur.\n\nApproximately 10% to 40% of patients have berry aneurysms, and approximately 9% of these patients die because of subarachnoid hemorrhages.\n\nOther abnormalities associated with ADPKD are mitral valve prolapse and colonic diverticulosis.\n\nHISTOPATHOLOGY:\nThe renal cysts range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter and appear diffusely throughout the cortex and medulla with communications at various points along the nephron.  Epithelial hyperplasia or even adenoma formation in the cyst wall is common, and the basement membrane of the wall is thickened. Arteriosclerosis is present in more than 70% of patients with preterminal or terminal renal failure, and interstitial fibrosis, with or without infiltrates, is common. This fibrosis may be secondary to infection or to an inflammatory reaction set off by spontaneously rupturing cysts.\n\nASSOCIATION WITH RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (RCC):\nThe incidence of RCC in patients with ADPKD is no higher than that in the general population.\n\nEVALUATION:\nTo make the diagnosis, it is important to have a history of the patient’s family spanning at least three generations.  When there is no family history to support a diagnosis of ADPKD, a presumptive diagnosis can be made if bilateral renal cysts are present and two or more of the following symptoms are present as well: bilateral renal enlargement; three or more hepatic cysts; cerebral artery aneurysm; and a solitary cyst of the arachnoid, pineal gland, pancreas, or spleen.\n\nIn adults, intravenous urography usually reveals bilateral renal enlargement, calyceal distortion, and a bubble or Swiss cheese appearance in the nephrogram phase. A CT scan or MRI may is superior to sonography for detecting cysts in organs other than the kidney. CT is helpful in making the diagnosis of hemorrhage within a cyst. More acute hemorrhage has a higher density (50 to 90 Hounsfield units [HU]) than old hemorrhage. MRI also may be helpful, particularly in patients with compromised renal function, because no contrast agent is needed\n\nEXAMINATION OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND GENETIC COUNSELING\nBecause ADPKD is an autosomal dominant condition, 50% of the children of affected adults will also be affected. Therefore, when the disease is diagnosed, the patient’s children should be examined by ultrasound. Before 1970, diagnosis of ADPKD before the age of 25 years was rare. With ultrasound, the possibility of making the diagnosis in affected individuals before this age is at least 85%. When genetic studies are used, the diagnostic accuracy approaches 100%.\n\nTREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS\nMore than 60% of patients with ADPKD who do not yet have renal impairment have hypertension, which can worsen renal function, cause cardiac disease, and predispose the patient to intracranial hemorrhage. The complications of ADPKD can be reduced significantly by controlling the blood pressure.\n\nAcute pain may be secondary to infection or hemorrhage into a cyst or to subcapsular bleeding. Chronic loin pain requiring narcotics is probably related to distention of cysts and the renal capsule. Some have proposed an operation that involves unroofing the cysts to relieve the pain. \n\nThe rate of renal deterioration seems to correlate with the rate of cyst growth.  Churchill, et al, calculated that patients with sonographically identifiable ADPKD have a 2% chance of developing end-stage renal failure by age 40 years, a 23% chance by age 50, and a 48% chance by age 73.\n\nEMERGING THERAPEUTICS:\nBecause polycystic kidney disease entities represents hyperplastic cystic conditions, Grantham suggested that it is time to treat polycystic kidney diseases like the neoplastic disorders they are. One such method would be to block the action of growth factors or their receptors. Another would be to consider chemotherapeutic agents.", "keywords": "ADPKD; autosomal; dominant; polycystic; kidney; disease;", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1996_synpic16444", "MPX1996_synpic16445", "MPX1996_synpic16446"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1996_synpic16444", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1996_synpic16444.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Multiple bilateral cysts.\nAX T1 RFF AST BH", "age": "41", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "8.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1996_synpic16445", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1996_synpic16445.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Multiple  bilateral renal cysts with T2W high signal intensity.\nAX T2 EXP BH", "age": "41", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "8.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1996_synpic16446", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1996_synpic16446.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MRA - MR Angiography/Venography", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Multiple nonenhancing bilateral renal cysts.", "age": "41", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "8.3", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n41 y/o black male presented to the ER with atypical chest pain.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVitals demonstrates hypertension (>190/>110) without laboratory evidence of end-organ damage (i.e., hypertensive urgency).\n\nPE is normal with non-focal neurologic exam.\nBUN - 17\nCreatinine - 1.2\n\nImaging Findings:\nMultiple, bilateral, cystic lesions are present on non-contrast MR.

Patient's often experience pre-syncopal symptoms of dizziness or even syncopal episodes when they turn their head to one of the sides.  This usually occurs when one of the vertebral arteries is occluded or severely stenosed secondary to any of the vascular occlusive diseases or congenitally diminutive caliver.  \n\nBy turning the head towards the side of occluded vertebral artery, a contralateral vertebral artery may get stretched or occluded.

Along the way, it gives rise to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, several jejunal and ileal branches, the middle colic artery, and the right colic artery.  Complete or partial occlusion of the SMA leads to acute mesenteric ischemia, with a mortality rate of 60-70%.   There are four major causes of acute mesenteric ischemia: 1) SMA embolism (50%); 2) SMA thrombosis (15-25%); 3) Mesenteric venous thrombosis (5%); 4) Nonocclusive ischemia (20 to 30 percent). ,   The SMA is particularly susceptible to embolic events of cardiac origin, due to it’s relatively large caliber, and narrow take-off angle from the descending aorta.   The embolus usually lodges 3 to 10 cm distal to the origin of the SMA, in a tapered segment distal to the take off of the middle colic artery.  In general, the clinical presentation of acute mesenteric ischemia is limited to sudden onset of pain, pain out of proportion to physical findings, and possibly some nausea and/or vomiting.  The laboratory findings are non-specific.  Radiographically, mesenteric angiography remains the gold standard diagnostic study for mesenteric arterial ischemia.  Plain fim radiography of the abdomen is non-specific, and in 25% of all cases, will be normal.   The use of traditional CT (with contrast) for the detection of mesenteric ischemia is limited by the ability of the radiologist to distinguish areas of decreased opacity distal to site of obstruction.  One small study demonstrated a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 92%.     MRA and Multi detector row CT (MDCT) hold promise as viable tools to evaluate mesenteric arteries, however no comparison studies are available for study.  Angiography therefore remains the gold standard.Treatment of mesenteric arterial embolism, traditionally, has been early surgical laparotomy with embolectomy.  Intra-operative palpation for SMA pulses is performed and the small bowel is carefully examined for areas of persistent ischemia, which are resected.  A \"second look\" laparotomy within the next 24 to 48 hours may be necessary to resect additional ischemic or gangrenous bowel.  A less well-established approach (which was used initially in this case) is local infusion of thrombolytic therapy, which has been successful in a number of reports. , ,  Thrombolytic therapy should only be considered in patients who can undergo angiography within eight hours of the onset of abdominal pain, and who do not have clinical evidence of bowel necrosis or other contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.  Surgical exploration is mandatory in patients who do not demonstrate clot lysis within four hours or develop evidence of progressive ischemia. Despite success in case series, the long-term reocclusion rate after thrombolytic therapy has not been well studied.  Long term treatment is aimed at limiting the chance of recurrence and usually requires the use of Warfarin.", "keywords": "thromboembolism", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1151_synpic19448", "MPX1151_synpic19449", "MPX1151_synpic19450", "MPX1151_synpic19451", "MPX1151_synpic19452", "MPX1151_synpic19453"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1151_synpic19448", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1151_synpic19448.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Vascular", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "1.

Most fetal diagnoses, however, are made later in pregnancy.\n\nArachnoid cysts usually occur from a congenital abnormality, arising from arachnoid clefts or arachnoid duplications.  They are not associated with chromosomal aneuploidy, but can be associated with brain malformations such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, absent cava, deficient cerebellar lobulation, and Arnold-Chiari type I malformation.  Acquired arachnoid cysts may develop due to CSF entrapment in arachnoid adhesions due to surgery, trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neonatal infections, or neoplasm.  They may or may not be connected to the ventricular system.  They can occur in both the cranium and the spinal canal.  They often indent a cerebral hemisphere or invaginate into fissures, however severe compression is rare.  Slow growth may occur with accumulation of fluid.\n\nArachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging.  If symptoms do occur, they may include headache, calvarial bulging, seizures, and less commonly focal neurologic signs.  Symptoms may occur due to cerebral cortical irritation, brain compression, or obstruction of CSF flow.  Diagnosis is made through imaging.\n\nDiagnostic imaging characteristics of arachnoid cysts on CT and MRI include having a smooth-surface, being non-enhancing with contrast, approximating CSF, and being homogeneous.  The consistency of the fluid in the cyst should approximate the CSF.  It should be homogeneous throughout, although simple septa within the cyst can occur.  The cysts usually occur near the cerebral fissures, with 50-60% in the middle cranial fossa.  They occur more commonly on the left side.\nSpecifically on MRI, these cysts are isointense or hypointense to brain on T1, and hyperintense to brain on T2.  MRI is superior to CT for detecting complicated cysts.\n\nFetal diagnosis of arachnoid cysts can be made by ultrasound.  Characteristics on ultrasound include seeing an anechoic cystic mass and thin smooth walls\nadjacent to the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, or brain stem.\n\nThis patient's arachnoid cyst is asymptomatic, and is likely not the cause of his hearing loss.

Additionally, any immunocompromised patient may be affected; organ recipients on immunosuppressive treatment, oncologic and hematologic patients, the elderly, severely malnourished children, and patients requiring prolonged corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe most common radiographic finding in patients with PCP consists of diffuse, bilateral symmetric ground-glass reticulonodular, or finely granular opacities occurring in a perihilar, or lower lung zone distribution.  Less commonly, PCP will occur with upper lobe predominance.  If untreated, these opacities may manifest as diffuse air space consolidation. As the disease progresses, interstitial disease will become more pronounced, and air cysts may be noticed in 5% to 35% of patients.  Occasionally, single or multiple nodules, miliary nodules, cavitation, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, and pleural effusion will be identified.  CT typically demonstrates symmetric bilateral ground-glass opacities, which may be diffuse, or have a mosaic pattern with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung giving a “crazy-paving” pattern. Spontaneous pneumothorax may be identified in 5% to 10% of patients, and is more common when cysts are present.   Pneumomediastinum may also be evident occurring by itself or in concert with pneumothorax.\n\nMost patients have characteristic radiographic findings of PCP, eliminating the need for CT.  However, in patients with symptoms and atypical radiographic findings, CT may show ground-glass opacities, that when correlated with the CD4+ count and other clinical markers may allow the correct diagnosis of PCP to be made.  Other causes of ground-glass opacities in patients with AIDS include CMV pneumonia and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.\n\nClinically, patients with PCP demonstrate nonspecific complaints.  Fever, cough, progressive dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, night sweats, and chest pain are all common symptoms.  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are frequently elevated, and patients demonstrate restrictive patterns on pulmonary function tests, with hypoxemia when exercising.  Clinicians may employ induced sputums, or use bronchoscopy with BAL to clinch the diagnosis.  BAL which has close to 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity in diagnosing PCP, is useful when positive, however when results are negative, transbronchial or open lung biopsy may be pursued when the clinical findings suggest a high probability of PCP.

(1, 2)  Early days of LC demonstrated a higher incidence of bile duct injuries and biliary leak, and initially this phenomenon was attributed to the \"learning curve\", but there is increasing evidence that the \"learning curve\" may not be entirely the reason why this is so. (2)\n\nIn the literature, biliary leaks after LC occur in approximately 1% of patients.  In a series of 64 patients with leaks addressed with endoscopic evaluation (ERCP), the vast majority of the leaks (50) were from the cystic duct.  Other places of biliary leaks were the ducts of Luschka (4), common bile duct (6), and common hepatic duct (4). (5)\n\nScintigraphic evaluation of patients with potential biliary leaks after LC has been clearly established in the literature (3, 4).  Other anatomic modalities such as US or CT can demonstrate a fluid collection, and a bile leak can be suggested from history, but it would be difficult to actually demonstrate a leak via purely anatomic studies alone.  Scintigraphic evaluation with an agent such as Tc99m-disofenin, as in this case, will clearly demonstrate whether or not the fluid collection is indeed a leakage of bile from the biliary system.\n\nTreatment of biliary leaks in this setting can be done by percutaneous drainage, but the literature demonstrates increasing use of endoscopic evaluation, sphincterotomy, and possible stent placement.

However, the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) autoantibodies are still circulating and affect other cell types with TSHR antigens such as fibroblasts, adipocytes, and T-cells contributing to tissue proliferation, inflammation and edema consistent with Grave's ophthalmopathy and pretibial myxedema.", "topic_title": "Grave's Ophthalmopathy", "acr_code": "1.2", "category": "Ophthalmology", "disease_discussion": "Grave’s ophthalmopathy (orbitopathy).  Although rare, it can occur in 2% patients with a history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.  Grave’s and Hashimoto’s diseases are on opposite sides of the thyroid disease spectrum — manifesting hyperthyroid and hypothyroid symptoms, respectively.  Both diseases can occur in the same person with variable temporal manifestations.  However, the majority of ophthalmopathy cases correlate with Grave’s disease.\n\nApproximately 10% of patients who have ophthalmopathy do not have clinical thyroid disease and are considered euthyroid, but do have elevated serum thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid-specific T-cells circulating.  Within the remaining 90% who do have clinical thyroid disease, approximately 40% have ophthalmic presentation within 6 months after diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, 20% have concurrent clinical thyroid and ophthalmic disease presentation, and 20% have ophthalmic involvement prior to diagnosis of thyroid disease.  Grave’s orbitopathy affects about 16 women and 3 men in a population of 100,000 per year with men having greater severity of disease.    \n\nRisk factors for development of Grave's ophthalmopathy are female, positive family history autoimmune diseases, smoking, age, and radioiodine therapy for Grave's hyperthyroidism (compared to surgery or antithyroid drugs). \n\nGrave’s orbitopathy results in bilateral proptosis, lid retraction, chemosis, and vision changes in affected persons attributing to the increase in retroorbital connective tissue and extraocular muscle enlargement.  Complications may involve corneal ulceration and infection due to loss of eye protection and lubrication.\n\nThe pathogenesis involves autoantibodies against thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antigens that can be found in the thyroid as well as in other tissues.  It is unknown why retroorbital tissues are predominantly affected.  Studies show that retroorbital fibroblasts and adipocytes express TSHR mRNA suggesting the mechanism of TSHR antibodies directly stimulating the fibroblasts and adipocytes resulting in increased production of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and fat tissue.\n\nAnother mechanism in the pathogenesis of Grave's ophthalmopathy involves T-cells that recognize self TSHR antigens as foreign.  This autoimmune process stimulates T-cells to produce cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interferon gamma that recruit lymphocytes and create inflammation and edema within the orbit.  Hence, there is lymphocytic infiltration of extraocular muscles and associated edema accounting for muscle belly enlargement.  It is not known why the inferior recti are usually affected first, followed by the medial recti, then superior recti, and lastly the lateral recti, but this is a consistent finding.\n\nTreatment for Grave's ophthalmopathy depends on severity of symptoms.

(Hellstrom et al 2004)", "topic_title": "Hiatal Hernia", "acr_code": "7.9", "category": "Hernia/herniation", "disease_discussion": "In the United States and Canada, a large proportion of adults undergoing upper gastrointestinal barium radiographs are found to have a small hiatal hernia. About 90% to 95% of hiatal hernias found by radiograph are sliding hernias, and the rest are paraesophageal or mixed.  Most sliding hiatal hernias are small and of little clinical significance. Patients with symptomatic paraesophageal hernias are most often middle-aged to elderly.  Many patients with small, simple sliding hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. The main clinical significance of the sliding hiatal hernia is its contribution to gastroesophageal reflux . In addition to heartburn and regurgitation, patients with large sliding hiatal hernias may complain of dysphagia or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen. In a prospective, population-based study the risk of iron-deficiency anemia was found to be increased  in adults with hiatal hernia. On chest radiograph a hiatal hernia may be noted as a soft tissue density in the retrocardiac area. Hiatal hernias are most often diagnosed on upper gastrointestinal barium radiographic studies. At endoscopy the gastroesophageal junction is noted to be proximal to the impression of the diaphragm. [1]\n\nPatients with paraesophageal and mixed hiatal hernias are rarely completely asymptomatic if closely questioned. About half of patients with paraesophageal hernias have gastroesophageal reflux. Other symptoms include dysphagia, chest pain, vague postprandial discomfort, and shortness of breath. A substantial number of patients have chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. If the hernia is complicated by gastric volvulus, acute abdominal pain and retching will occur, often progressing rapidly to a surgical emergency. A paraesophageal or mixed hiatal hernia may be seen on chest radiograph as an abnormal soft tissue density (often with a gas bubble) in the mediastinum. Upper gastrointestinal radiograph is the best diagnostic study. [1]\n\nHiatal hernias are occasionally complicated by volvulus. The stomach is normally fixed in position by ligamentous attachments to the duodenum, spleen, liver, and diaphragm. Laxity of these ligaments, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, adhesions, gastric tumor, or masses in adjacent organs may predispose to volvulus. In about one third of cases the volvulus occurs below the diaphragm. In the other two thirds of cases volvulus occurs above the diaphragm in association with a diaphragmatic hernia. Sliding hiatal hernias are not associated with gastric volvulus.  Gastric volvulus may be mesenteroaxial or organoaxial. In about 60% of cases gastric volvulus is organoaxial: the stomach twists along its long axis. This axis usually passes through the gastroesophageal and gastropyloric junctions. The antrum rotates anteriorly and superiorly, the fundus posteriorly and inferiorly, twisting the greater curvature at some point along its length. This type of volvulus is commonly associated with a diaphragmatic hernia. Organoaxial volvulus is usually an acute event. Vascular compromise and gastric infarction may occur. The other major type of gastric volvulus is mesenteroaxial, in which the stomach folds on its short axis running across from the lesser curvature to the greater curvature, and the antrum twists anteriorly and superiorly. [1]\n\nSimple sliding hiatal hernias do not require treatment. Patients with symptomatic giant sliding hiatal hernias, paraesophageal, and mixed hernias should be offered surgery. Many experts suggest that surgery should be offered to patients with asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias, because about 30% of these patients will develop complications if left untreated. Many surgeons routinely perform a fundoplication on all repairs, both to prevent postoperative reflux esophagitis and to fix the stomach in the abdomen. Less commonly a gastrostomy is used to fix the stomach in position. Patients with sliding hiatal or paraesophageal hernias may have shortening of the esophagus. This makes it difficult to restore the gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragm without tension. In such cases an extra length of neoesophagus can be constructed from the proximal stomach (Colles-Nissen procedure). Paraesophageal and mixed hernias can be repaired through the chest or abdomen, with open or laparoscopic techniques. Compared with open repair, laparoscopic repair is associated with less blood loss, fewer overall complications, shorter hospital stay, and quicker return to normal activities. Long-term results are probably equal with either approach. Potential surgical complications include esophageal and gastric perforation, pneumothorax, and liver laceration. Potential long-term complications may include dysphagia if the wrap is too tight or gastroesophageal reflux if the fundoplication breaks down or migrates into the chest. Recurrence rates are about 10 [1]\n \n\n1.

Most of these cases are due to advanced gastric carcinoma and less commonly related to metastatic cancer or invasion of adjacent malignancies such as bile duct cancer or gallbladder cancer.

Obstruction is from severe luminal narrowing resulting from spasm, acute inflammation and edema, muscular hypertrophy, or contraction of scar tissue.  Distortion and scarring of the duodenal bulb make peptic ulcer disease the most likely cause of obstruction, while a radiographically normal bulb increases the likelihood of underlying malignant disease.  These patients often have a long history of ulcer pain.  \n\nInflammatory disorders which cause gastric outlet obstruction include Crohn’s disease, sarcoidosis, syphyllis, tuberculosis, amyloidosis, corrosive stricture, pancreatitis, and cholecystitis.

Sacrococcygeal teratoma occurs in approximately 1 in 35,000 births but is reportedly the most common tumor encountered among neonates.  The prenatal diagnosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma carries a very low rate of malignancy.  However, the size and extension of the tumor is more important than the histology in prenatal studies.  It may be mainly exterior with only a minimal presacral component, predominantly external with a significant intrapelvic component, predominantly internal with intra-abdominal extension, or entirely internal with no external component.  The majority of sacrococcygeal teratomas are solid or mixed cystic and solid; only 15% are entirely cystic (as in this case).  An intra-abdominal component often displaces the urinary bladder anteriorly and may obstruct the ureters.\n\nThe differential diagnosis depends on whether the mass is predominantly solid or cystic and external or internal.  Other solid or complex masses in the sacrococcygeal region include chordoma, neurogenic tumor, lipoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, hemangioma, malignant melanoma, and meconium pseudocyst extending into the solid tissues.  A predominantly or entirely cystic mass may resemble a myelomeningocele, which must be excluded by demonstrating intact posterior spinal elements.  However, the teratoma may extend into the lumbosacral canal, and sacrococcygeal teratoma may occur with associated vertebral anomalies which make this distinction very difficult.  The differential diagnosis for an entirely intra-abdominal sacrococcygeal teratoma includes ovarian cyst, meconium pseudocyst, enteric duplication cyst, or other bowel-related abnormality.\n\nApproximately 25% of fetuses with sacrococcygeal teratoma develop hydrops, probably secondary to the vascularity of the tumor.

The tumor will continue to enlarge during skeletal growth, but typically becomes latent at skeletal maturity.  \n\n•  Synonyms:  Osteocartilaginous Exostosis\n\n•  Common  Locations:  The most common site of origin for an osteochondroma is the metaphysis at bony sites of tendon and ligamentous attachments.  Common sites include distal femur, proximal humerus, proximal tibia but also may occur less frequently in the pelvis, scapula, spine or any bone preformed in cartilage.\n\n•  Demographics:  Typically occur in first to third decades with prevalence greater in males than in females.  It is the most common skeletal tumor in children with an occurrence of 1 in 200.   They may be solitary or multiple and they may arise spontaneously.\n\n•  Gross  Morphology:  Osteochondromas vary in size.  The average lesion arising from tubular bones is approximately 4cm.  Osteochondromas arising from flat bones tend to be larger with a higher likelihood of malignant transformation.\n\n•  Histology:  Pathologic sections show osteochondromas to have a cartilaginous cap.  Histologically, the cartilaginous cap is identical to the physeal growth plate.  During active growth, the cap is composed of hyaline cartilage.  The thickness of the cap is correlated with the age of the patient, and the cap decreases in size as patient’s age.    In children and adolescents, the cap may be as thick as 3cm, whereas in older patients, it may be thin.  A thick cartilaginous cap (>1cm) in an adult should raise the possibility of malignant transformation (usually chondrosarcomas)\n\n•  Radiology:  Plain radiographic appearances of an osteochondroma are those of a pedunculated or sessile bony excrescence with well-defined margins.  In adults, the cartilage cap often contains flecks of calcification. Continuity of the osteochondroma with the medullary canal is a characteristic finding,  particularly obvious in long bones.   MR imaging is able to detect continuity of the cortical and medullary bone in the outgrowth with that of the parent bone.  This finding is diagnostic of an osteochondroma.  Of greatest utility in the functionality of the MR is the ability to precisely identify and measure the cartilaginous cap of an osteochondroma using T2 weighted spin echo images.  These measurements can be used to supply information regarding the likelihood of malignant changes.\n\n•  Prognosis  and  Treatment:  Most solitary osteochondromas are discovered in children and adolescents  and are painless, slow-growing masses and require no treatment.  Significant symptoms may occur as a result of complications such as fracture, bony deformity, mechanical joint problems, and vascular or neurologic compromise.  Appreciable morbidity is related to resection of osteochondromas and corrective surgery on the osseous deformity.  Resections are typically only performed on mature bone due to the risk of damage to the epiphyseal growth plate resulting in severe growth deformity in the affected bone.  Serial radiographs are performed to monitor for malignant transformation which is estimated at 1% for solitary osteochondromas.

In patients with either a known malignancy or no known malignancy, benign adrenal masses are more common than adrenal gland metastases.  It is important to be able to differentiate between a benign and malignant adrenal mass as the distinction ultimately affects treatment decisions and overall prognosis for oncology patients.  \n\nBenign adrenal adenomas contain increased intracytoplasmic lipid content resulting in low attenuating lesions (less than 10 HU) on noncontrast CT scans.  Typically, adrenal adenomas are smaller than 4 cm, appearing as smoothly marginated, homogeneous, round masses.  In contrast, metastatic lesions to the adrenal gland are large, heterogeneous, lobulated masses with poorly defined margins, and contain very little intracellular fat.\n\nAn attenuation value of less than 10 HU on noncontrast CT scans is diagnostic of an adrenal adenoma.  However it is important to note that an attenuation value greater than 10 HU is not necessarily diagnostic of a metastatic lesion.  Approximately 30% of benign adenomas will yield attenuation values greater than 10 HU.  Thus, contrast enhanced CT can be employed to further characterize a adrenal lesion.\n\nAfter the administration of intravenous contrast material, benign adrenal adenomas avidly enhance, and the washout of contrast material is more rapid than with metastases.  Comparing noncontrast scans, with immediate postcontrast scans, and following with delayed postcontrast scans (15 minutes after contrast administration) the percentage enhancement washout of a adrenal lesion can be calculated, and determined as benign or malignant.  \n\nPercentage enhancement washout is calculated as the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the delayed enhancement attenuation divided by the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the nonenhanced attenuation multiplied by 100%.  If the percentage enhancement washout is greater than 60%, then the adrenal lesion can be characterized as a benign adrenal adenoma.  Additionally, if the nonenhanced attenuation is unavailable, the relative percentage enhancement washout can be calculated similarly as the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the delayed enhancement attenuation divided by the immediate enhancement attenuation multiplied by 100%.  If the relative percentage enhancement washout is greater than 50%, then the adrenal lesion can be classified as a benign adrenal adenoma.  Values of less than either 60% or 50% for the appropriate calculation are indicative of either a metastases or an atypical adenoma.\n\nIf an adrenal lesion cannot be adequately characterized on contrast enhanced CT, chemical shift MR imaging can be used exploiting the knowledge that adrenal adenomas contain intracellular lipid.  Chemical shift MR is the difference in behavior of lipid and water protons in a magnetic field.  Within an imaged voxel, gradient echo image sequences are performed to separate fat and water protons.  Using the spleen as an internal standard, demonstrating loss of signal within an adrenal mass on the T1-weighted out-of-phase image when compared to a corresponding T1-weighted in-phase image, confirms the presence of intracellular lipid, which characterizes a benign adrenal adenoma.

Because of osteoclast dysfunction, bone remodeling is impaired and the primary calcified substantia spongiosa ossium is not reabsorbed.  Eventually, the normal marrow spaces may become obliterated, resulting in pancytopenia.\n\nTwo modes of genetic transmission have been described: autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant.  Autosomal recessive is associated with worse outcomes, as most patient’s die from infection or bone marrow failure before adolescence.  The autosomal dominant form is frequently discovered incidentally in adulthood with benign outcomes. \n\nClinical presentations for the autosomal recessive form include failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia, and cranial nerve dysfunction.  Progressive loss of the normal marrow leads to pancytopenia and predisposes to recurrent infection.  Other associations include renal tubular acidosis and neuronal storage diseases.  \n\nVarious synonyms include: Albers-Schonberg disease, osteosclerosis, osteopetrosis generalisata, and marble bones disease. \n\nPrecocious Type: Radiographic findings are characterized by generalized osteosclerosis.  Tubular bones demonstrate a failure of differentiation between the cortex and medullary cavity.  A bone within bone appearance may be seen.\n\nDelayed Type: May be detected because of a pathologic fracture.  The radiographic findings are similar to the autosomal recessive form. Bones are diffusely osteosclerotic, with defective tubulation and a thickened cortex.  The vertebral endplates are accentuated, producing a “sandwich” vertebra appearace in children, and a “rugger-jersey” spine may be seen in adults. A bone within bone appearance is frequently seen.\n\nIntermediate Recessive Type: Short stature patients, with pathologic fractures, anemia, and hepatomegaly, characterized by diffuse bone sclerosis, bone within bone appearance, and retained primary and impaced permanent teeth.

Skip lesions may also occur, with eventual involvement of the colon in 70%. Initial presentation is in the teens or early twenties, with males and females equally affected. Onset may be insidious, with initial symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea and low grade fever, to more acute symptoms resembling appendicitis. The earliest macroscopic manifestation is apthoid ulceration of the gut mucosa with eventual enlargement of the ulcers and confluence thereof. Microscopically small granulomas resembling sarcoid granulomas are found, containing multinucleated giant cells of Langhans’ type. Interestingly, such granulomas are more frequently found in the lymph nodes draining the diseased segment, and less so in the segment itself.  Ultimate complete loss of mucosa, fibrosis and narrowing of the lumen is a common outcome. Associated inflammation leads to mass effect displacing or effacing structures in the right lower quadrant. Due to the transmural ulceration fistulization between adjacent loops of small bowel and the colon may be seen, as well as fistulization between the bladder, vagina, ureter, and skin.  The proximal small bowel, stomach, and esophagus may also be affected, in that decreasing order of frequency. Such proximal involvement, however, rarely occurs independent of terminal ileal involvement. \n\n\nPrevious studies of nuclear medicine inflammatory bowel imaging demonstrate good correlation between locale of uptake on In-111/WBC scanning and region of bowel affected, however Tc-99m HMPAO/WBC scanning has been shown to demonstrate better localization properties. Additionally, Tc-99m provides a lesser radiation dose to the spleen by virtue of its shorter half life (6hrs vs 67 hrs); thus it is preferred in the pediatric population. Finally, Tc-99mHMPAO/WBC results may be obtained as rapidly as within one hour after injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Should In-111/WBC scanning be done, however, initial imaging should be done at 4 hours rather than the typical 24 hour delay. This is because there will be shedding of leukocytes from the inflamed bowel and peristalsis will carry the labeled leukocytes distally, possibly resulting in inaccuracy in determining site of inflammation. \n\nUse of  F-18 FDG PET scanning in the evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease is promising.

Radionuclide study; CT; MRI; and, occasionally, angiography are complementary examinations. Any or all may be used to arrive at a diagnosis.  The ribs show lytic expansile lesions, which may be associated with pathologic fractures.  Lesions are lytic, round or oval, and expansile, with ill-defined or sclerotic margins.  The medullary cavity may be expanded and associated with cortical thinning, intracortical tunneling, and erosion of the cortex and an adjacent soft-tissue mass.  Laminated periosteal new bone formation is common around the involved segment of bone.\n\t CT scans may be particularly useful in osseous lesions in areas with complex anatomy, such as the mastoids, atlantoaxial joints, and posterior elements of the vertebral bodies. Also, soft tissue components are better depicted on CT scans than on other images. The destruction of the mastoid, petrous ridge, tegmen tympani, and lateral sinus plate and the destruction of the inner and external ear are depicted elegantly on CT scans. CT may demonstrate an isoattenuating and homogeneously enhancing mass in the hypothalamus/pituitary gland.  CT is considerably better than plain radiography and conventional tomography in depicting an intracranial extension of EG.   CT appearances of EG are nonspecific, and a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic processes may mimic EG.\n\tOn spin-echo MRIs, osseous lesions of EG reveal decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted and high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. The lesion may enhance after the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent.  The value of using MRI to image patients with EG lies in the sensitivity of MRI because its specificity is low.

Any bone and be involved, but the most common sites include the skull, mandible, spine, ribs, and long bones.\n\n-Etiology and Pathogenesis: \n\n  EG is a benign disorder that affects children and young adults, particularly males.  The solitary bone lesion may be asymptomatic, or it may cause bone pain because of expansion of the medullary bone.  Pathologic fractures may ensue. The pathogenesis of LCH is unknown.  An ongoing debate exists over whether this is a reactive or neoplastic process.  Arguments supporting the reactive nature of this disorder include the occurrence of spontaneous remissions, the failure to detect aneuploidy, metaphase or karyotypic abnormalities, and the good survival rate in patients without organ dysfunction. On the other hand, the infiltration of organs by aberrant cells, a possible lethal evolution, and the cancer-based modalities of successful treatment are all consistent with a neoplastic process. In addition, the demonstration of LCH as a monoclonal proliferation by X chromosome-linked DNA probes supports a neoplastic origin for this proliferation; however, the presence of this finding in distinct subtypes with different evolutions demands further investigations to evaluate its significance. \nThere is evidence for a role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of LCH by the creation of a permissive immunosurveillance system. Abnormalities of suppressor cell number and function have been documented in several reports. Increased levels of messenger RNA for macrophage colony stimulating factor and platelet derived growth factor have been detected in cells from a pulmonary LCH lesion.\n\n-Epidemiology:\n  LCH is a rare disease. Estimated annual incidence ranges from 0.5-5.4 per million persons per year. Approximately 1200 new cases per year are reported in the United States.   More than half of the patients younger than 2 years, with disseminated LCH and organ dysfunction die of the disease; whereas, unifocal LCH and the majority of cases of congenital self-healing histiocytosis, are self-limited. Multifocal chronic LCH is self-limited in most cases, though increased mortality has been observed among infants with pulmonary involvement.  Prevalence of LCH seems to be higher among whites.  Incidence of LCH is greater in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 2:1).   LCH affects patients from neonates to adults. Age of onset varies according to the variety of LCH. Letterer-Siwe disease occurs predominantly in children younger than 2 years. The chronic multifocal form, including the Hand-Schuller-Christian syndrome, has a peak of onset between 2-10 years of age. Localized eosinophilic granuloma occurs mostly frequently in those aged 5-15 years.\n\n-Clinical Manifestations:\n  Most patients have no symptoms, and the diagnosis is usually based on radiographic demonstration of a destructive bone lesion arising from the marrow cavity and on characteristic morphologic findings. Localized bone pain and focal tenderness may occur as a result of bone erosion and, rarely, a pathologic fracture. A swelling or mass may be palpable at the site of osseous involvement. Rarely, children may present with fever and leukocytosis. Involvement of the mastoid process involvement may appear with intractable otitis media with a chronic discharge. Mandibular involvement may present with gingival and continuous soft-tissue swelling.\n\n- Diagnosis:\n  Definite diagnosis is based on biopsy.  Because of the absence of distinctive morphologic characteristics of the LCH cell, special studies are used to identify the cell. The Birbeck granule is the distinctive ultrastructural hallmark of the LC. It consists of an intracytoplasmic membranous body, 33 nm wide and 190-360 nm long, possessing a short, rodlike shape with a dotted line down the midline of the space between the membranes (resembling a zipper) and a terminal expansion in the form of a vesicle giving a \"racquet\" appearance. Although these granules are resistant to destruction by formalin fixation and paraffin embedding, the sensitivity of detection in such specimens is slightly decreased. Birbeck granules are rarely detected in lesions of the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and spleen. Langerhans cells also contain laminated substructures of lysosomes, tuboreticular structures, and trilaminar membranous loops.  \nThe Writing Group of the Histiocyte Society (1987) has proposed 3 levels of certainty in the diagnosis of LCH based on the clinical features, histopathology, and special immunohistochemical techniques. A presumptive diagnosis is based on a typical clinical presentation and light microscopic findings. A designated diagnosis includes light microscopy in combination with positive S-100 and PNA staining studies. To make a definitive diagnosis, identification of Birbeck granules and CD1a antigens is required.\n\n-Treatment:\n  Solitary bone lesions are treated locally with curettage or excision.  Painful bone lesions may require intralesional steroid injection (triamcinolone acetonide).  Polyostotic bone lesions are best treated with indomethacin or a short course of systemic steroids.  Rarely, lesions that are unusually large and painful occur in inaccessible sites or involve vital structures. They require radiation (3-6 Gy [300-600 rads]).", "keywords": "EGLangerhans cell histiocytosishistiocytosis X", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1750_synpic18372", "MPX1750_synpic18487", "MPX1750_synpic18488", "MPX1750_synpic18490"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1750_synpic18372", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1750_synpic18372.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A non-contrast axial CT image of the chest in Bone window demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.", "age": "23", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "471.663", "figure_part": "2e"}, {"image_id": "MPX1750_synpic18487", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1750_synpic18487.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A non-contrast axial CT image of the chest in Bone window demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.", "age": "23", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "471.663", "figure_part": "2a"}, {"image_id": "MPX1750_synpic18488", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1750_synpic18488.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A non-contrast axial CT image of the chest in Bone window demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.", "age": "23", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "471.663", "figure_part": "2b"}, {"image_id": "MPX1750_synpic18490", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1750_synpic18490.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A non-contrast axial CT image of the chest in Bone window demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.", "age": "23", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "471.663", "figure_part": "2d"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n23 y/o female with 6-week history of right sided chest pain.

These latter patients rarely come to CT because of instability. Contrast-enhanced CT is the procedure of choice for evaluating hepatic injuries in stable patients. It can define the extent of injury, detect associated injuries and roughly quantitate the amount of hemoperitoneum. The amount of hemoperitoneum does not always correlate with clinical stability and the need for immediate surgery. Fairly large hepatic injuries may be missed without intravenous contrast enhancement. Conversely, small hematomas may be visible as densities on a non-contrast scan (and obscured by contrast-enhanced parenchyma). These are usually not clinically significant and preliminary non-contrast CT may be safely omitted when you are pressed for time. If non-operative management is chosen, CT or sonography can be used for follow-up. The liver injuries likely to be encountered on CT include contusions, subcapsular and parenchymal hematomas, lacerations and fractures. Contusions are ill-defined intraparenchymal lucencies. Subcapsular hematomas are lenticular lucent peripheral collections that indent the liver contour. Intraparenchymal hematomas are rounded or slightly irregular lucent collections.

This test is a nuclear medicine study that compares images of inhaled radionuclide material to pulmonary perfusion images of intravenously injected radiolabeled protein.  These images must be closely compared to a chest X-ray taken at or near the time of the V/Q scan.  This is done to ensure defects on the V/Q images are not accounted for by findings on the chest X-ray.  A high probability scan, defined as two or more moderate or large segmental mismatched perfusion defects, in the presence of high clinical suspicion was found to be accurate 96% of the time in the PIOPED study.  The same study also found that a low probability scan in the presence of low clinical suspicion was only falsely negative in 6% of the patients.  However, this leaves a large number of cases in which there is either a moderate clinical suspicion, an intermediate scan, or a discrepancy between pre-test clinical suspicion and final test results.  Therefore, more invasive tests such as pulmonary angiography must often be used for a definitive diagnosis.  \n\nThe chest X-ray is also an important tool in the evaluation a patient with a suspected PE.

Bone is a very dynamimc tissue that continuously remodels as a result of altering stresses. Repetitive stress overload results in an imbalance of bone remodeling. The abnormal level of stress results in the bone resorption exceeding the rate of bone repalcement leading to a weakening of the bone.  There is a continuum of injury beginning with weakening of the bone, fatigue, stress fracture and finally, complete fracture of the involved bone.\n\nStress injuries of bones are very common among athletes and can occur in nearly any bone, however, the vast majority of stress injuries occur in the bones of the lower extremity. Tarsal navicular stress fractures typically occur in elite athletes, including runners, basketball players, gymnasts, and football players. Those athletes that play on artificial turf seem to be at an increased risk for stress fractures of the tarsal navicular bone.\n\nThe diagnosis of tarsal navicular stress fracture is often delayed many weeks to months because the onset of symptoms are insidious and in addition, the diagnosis is often difficult to make on conventional radiographs. Patients usually present with pain along the dorsal aspect of the foot which is made worse by running or jumping. Tarsal navicular stress fractures are usually treated with casting and athletes typically return to full activity within 5 to 6 months. If a complete fracture occurs, the individual may require internal fixation, which can delay return to normal activity.\n\nMost tarsal navicular stress fractures occur in the middle third of the navicular bone, which is a relatively avascular portion of the bone. The fracture may be complete or incomplete, however the incomplete fractures tend to begin along the dorsal aspect of the bone adjacent to the talonavicular joint. Foot anomalies can be associated with stress fractures of the tarsal navicular. This injury is most often seen in individuals that have a short first metatarsal or long second metatarsal. This is thought to result in increased shear forces being transmitted along the second metatarsal through the middle cunieform and into the middle third of the navicular bone.\n\nEvaluation of a suspected stress injury of the tarsal navicular should begin with radiographs of the foot, however this area of the navicular is difficult to visualize on radiographs and MR or CT is often required to correctly establish the diagnosis.", "keywords": "stress fracturetarsal navicularfoot", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1118_synpic17090"], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1118_synpic17088", "MPX1118_synpic17089"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1118_synpic17090", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1118_synpic17090.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "A lucnet line which represents the stress fracture extends through the middle third of the tarsal navicular bone.

The intralobar variant drains to the pulmonary veins or left atrium, the extralobar type to the systemic venous system (the inferior vena cava or the azygous system).

Inflammation of the pericardium (i.e. pericarditis) can be the result of many different etiologies.  The most common of these etiologies include infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal and TB), post-MI, association with malignancy (breast, lung, lymphoproliferative and melanoma), association with systemic disease (uremia, hypothyroidism and connective tissue disorders) and post-chest radiation exposure (Primack 1998). \n\nThe most common result of acute pericarditis is the formation of a pericardial effusion, which can be transudative or exudative depending on the underlying pathology.  Clinical signs of effusion include pericardial friction rub, chest pain, increased dullness over precordium and pulsus paradoxus.  Plain film diagnosis of pericardial disease is based on the observation of the changes in the contours of the heart borders contained by the pericardium (Rozenshtein 1999).  Radiographic signs of pericardial effusion include a smooth generalized increase in size of the cardiac silhouette without specific chamber enlargement, \"water-bottle\" or \"globular\" cardiac configuration and an anterior pericardial stripe thicker than 2 mm in the lateral view (Rozenshtein 1999).  \n\nPericardial effusion can progress to the point where diastolic filling of the ventricles is severely impeded and the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.  This condition is termed cardiac tamponade and is heralded clinically by Beck's triad, which includes muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins and hypotension.  Pulsus paradoxus is another clinical sign frequently seen in tamponade.  Because acute tamponade is possible with small effusions, plain films are not a sensitive technique for detecting clinically significant pericardial enlargement.  Subtle changes in cardiac contour may only be evident through comparison to prior films.  If there is cardiac enlargement with decreased pulmonary vasculature or if the azygous and SVC are dilated, one should have a high index of suspicion for tamponade (Rozenshtein 1999).", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2171_synpic20416"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2171_synpic20416", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2171_synpic20416.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Large pericardial effusion", "age": "19", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "55.821", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nPatient is a 19 year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant, with history of systemic lupus erythematosus.

These lesions typically present in young adults in the 2nd to 5th decade with complaints referable to acute or chronic hydrocephalus. Other symptoms include ataxia, memory disturbances, and gait disorders. The cyst contents include secretory and breakdown products of the epithelial lining tissue, including hemorrhage, lipid (cholesterol), hemosiderin, and CSF. \n\nOn T1-weighted MR images, these cysts vary widely from hypo- to hyperintense in comparison to normal brain. Although they may be bright on T2-weighted images, moderate to marked hypointensity is common and has been attributed to a very short T1 relaxation time or to magnetic susceptibility effect from paramagnetic substances in the cyst. On noncontrast MR, these lesions occasionally are indistinguishable by intensity from neoplasia; however, the absence of enhancement, classic location, and relative hypointensity on T2-weighted studies should suggest this diagnosis. Treatment is variable, including ventricular shunting alone, stereotactic cyst drainage, or surgical resection. \n\nOn noncontrast CT, colloid cysts are solitary, round to oval, usually hyperdense masses at the foramen of Monro with associated enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles (Film .3). Minimal or absent contrast enhancement is typical. Moderate enhancement with contrast suggests a different etiology, such as glioma, craniopharyngioma, choroid plexus papilloma, or remotely meningioma.

The condition can be manifested shortly after birth, or it can remain asymptomatic for the life of the individual and be found subsequently on postmortem exam.  Due to this large variation in presentation, this defect presents itself along a wide spectrum, making it difficult to diagnose unless imaging of the brain is preformed.  \n\n\tOccurrence of corpus callosal defects is said to occur in roughly 0.7-5.3% of the US population, with a suggested similar worldwide occurrence .  The condition is noted to be hereditary in some cases, being passed down either as an X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant depending on the associated disease.  It has also been known to occur often with one of the many different trisomies, most often to include 8, 13, 18, and 21 .  Conditions which often coincide with this defect include Chiari II malformations, encephalocele, schizencephaly, lissencephaly, and many syndromes such as Aicardi’s, CRASH and fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\t\n\tThe congenital form of callosal agenesis usually occurs due to a defect in embryological development during the 7-20th gestational week .  Normal development of the corpus callosum begins with formation from the commissural plate of the telencephalon .  The genu and the body are formed first, followed in time by the development of the rostrum and splenium. From this, white matter axons develop which form projections into the bilateral cerebral cortices. An embryological defect in any of the stages can cause either complete or partial agenesis of the callosum, if occurring later in development a defect in the posterior section is generally observed.  Finally, if the genu and body are dysgenic, one can assume that a secondary cause is manifesting such as infection or hemorrhage due to the embryologic sequence of formation previously mentioned. \n\n\tPresentation usually occurs secondary to an associated congenital defect, mental retardation, seizures, or as an incidental finding on an MRI.  Diagnosis is best performed by MRI, which demonstrates much finer detail of the lesion and any surrounding neuronal disturbances.  Findings often noted in addition to an agenic/dysgenic corpus callosum include a high riding third ventricle, enlarged occipital horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly), longitudinal straightening of the lateral ventricles, and parallel white matter bands along the midline where the corpus would normally develop termed “Probst bundles.” In addition, the absence of the cingulate gyrus results in the sulci of the inner aspect of the cerebrum to be found to radiate outwards from the third ventricle instead of their normal appearance surrounding the corpus. Imaging is usually performed by midline sagittal MRI in order to fully demonstrate the extent of callosal dysgenesis, coronal views to best visualize Probst bundles if present, and axial views which  demonstrate colpocephaly.  T1, T2, FLAIR, and proton density enhanced scans can all be used in conjunction with each other to best visualize the anatomy of the lesion and its surrounding parts.\n\nTherapy for this condition depends completely upon the clinical presentation of the disease, along with any associated syndromes. Due to the wide range of presenting factors, some individuals may go their entire life unaware of their lesion, while others may present at birth.

This anomaly presents either unilaterally or bilaterally, and is estimated to occur in up to fifteen percent of the population.  Most individuals with a duplicated renal collecting system remain asymptomatic with their anomaly being found incidentally on imaging studies.  Those patients who become symptomatic with their duplicated collecting system generally have two distinct and complete urters, and are prone to developing obstruction, reflux, and infection.\n     A duplicated renal collecing system forms by one of two ways.  The first results from the embryologic bifurcation of a single ureteral bud prior to the bifurcation of the ampulla, and produces either a bifid ureteral pelvis or a bifid ureter which joins distally prior to bladder insertion.  The second results when two distinct embryologic ureteral buds arise from the Wolffian duct, giving rise to two complete and separate ureters which insert separately into the bladder.  In this second case, with two separate ureters, the upper pole ureter drains below and medial to the lower pole ureter at its insertion.  According to the Weigert-Meyer rule, the upper pole ureter is prone to obstruction and hydronephrosis as well as ureterocele formation, while the lower pole ureter is prone to refulx and at is risk for pyleonephritis.  Additionally, this upper pole ureter may insert ectopically inferior to the bladder (e.g. urethera, or vagina), causing continual leakage of urine in females (not the case in males as the ectopic insertion is proximal to the external uretheral sphinter).", "keywords": "renal collecting system duplicationcollecting system anomalyWiegert-Meyer rule", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1950_synpic27241", "MPX1950_synpic27243"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1950_synpic27241", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1950_synpic27241.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Three delayed contrast enhanced CT images of the abdomen demonstrating the left kidney with a superior pole and collecting system, a more inferior image of the left kidney with parenchyma and no collecting system (the so-called \\\"faceless\\\" kidney), and a still more inferior image of the left kidney with the reappearance of a collecting system, consistent with a duplicated collecting system.", "age": "36", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "8.1", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1950_synpic27243", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1950_synpic27243.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - GI & IV Contrast", "plane": "3D Reconstruction", "location": "Genitourinary", "location_category": "Reproductive and Urinary System", "caption": "Multiplanar reformatted contrast enhanced CT image of the left kidney along the long axis of the kidney demonstarting a bifid ureter.", "age": "36", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "8.1", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n36 year old female with a liver mass.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nN/A\n\nImaging Findings:\nTriple phase IV contrast study of the abdomen demonstrates a liver hemangioma, and incidental note is made of a left-sided bifid ureter.", "has_history": true, "has_findings": true, "has_diagnosis": true, "has_images": true, "is_complete": true}

(Reeder)  The focus here will be considerations in distinguishing diverticular disease versus carcinoma in the setting of large bowel obstruction.  Diverticular disease has sigmoid involvement in 99% of the cases in industrialized Western countries. (Farrell)  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the GI tract and the second most common malignant tumor in the United States. (Beutow)  Approximately 50% arise in the rectum and rectosigmoid area.  Another 25% occur in the sigmoid colon, and the remaining 25% are evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the colon. (Beutow)  The determination of benign versus malignant stricture in the sigmoid colon is very important because of the differences in the treatment.  In addition,  the implications for staging of cancer and determination of appropriate therapy are issues that make identifying the correct diagnosis vital.  Further, large bowel obstruction secondary to sigmoid strictures is not uncommon.  In fact, the most common cause of large bowel obstruction is primary colon cancer estimated at 53% while diverticular disease is the cause in approximately 12% of the cases. (Greenllee)\n\tThe barium enema and computed tomography (CT) are two modalities used often to evaluate the cause of a sigmoid stricture.  There are general characteristics used to delineate benign versus malignant strictures with both. With the barium enema, a gradual zone of transition, preserved mucosal folds and presence of diverticula are considered benign features.  In contrast , an abrupt transition at the site of obstruction, destruction of mucosa and apple core configuration are considered malignant features. (Blakeborough)  It has been shown that in making  the diagnosis of diverticulitis with CT, the most specific findings are pericolonic stranding and length of the involved segment of more than 10 cm. The presence of pericolonic edema also favors diverticulitis. For colon cancer, the most specific findings are the presence of pericolonic lymph nodes and luminal mass. (Chintapalli)  In cases in which the patient presents with large bowel obstruction, both of these modalities may be helpful in evaluating the cause.  An added advantage of  barium enema is its benefit in aiding in the differentiation of mechanical versus pseudoobstruction.\n\tChapman et al reviewed 140 cases of LBO to determine the accuracy of water-soluble contrast enema in comparison with plain abdominal radiography. Findings at laparotomy and follow-up (for the nonoperative cases) were used as the reference. When reviewing the plain radiographs (being aware of the case history), the diagnosis of mechanical obstruction was made with a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 72%, respectively, whereas contrast enema had a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 98%, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

In a review of 1090 normotensive patients without coagulopathy who underwent the procedure between 1993 and 1997 the risk of post-biopsy minor hematoma formation was found to be 2.2% (3). More severe injuries such as loss of a kidney, life threatening hemorrhage, or persisting AV fistula have been reported but are considered exceedingly rare and did not occur in the study cited here. \n\nRenal injuries are typically classified in one of four radiologic categories (2):\n\nCategory I – Cortical Contusion; Subcapsular Hematoma; Minor Laceration with Mild Perinephric Hematoma; or Small Cortical Infarct (2).\n\nCategory II – Major Laceration with medullary involvement; Segmental Infarct (2). \n\nCategory III-  Multiple Renal Lacerations; Vascular Pedicle Injury (2).\n\nCategory IV-  UPJ Injury (2)\n\nIn evaluating a suspected renal injury, CT is the primary modality relied upon to detect and characterize a lesion (2). Using contrast enhanced CT, a renal injury such as a hematoma or laceration can be evaluated and the presence of active hemorrhage or urinary extravasation can frequently be documented (2).\n\nSubcapsular hematomas appear on CT imaging as a crescenteric enlargement surrounding all or a portion of the renal cortex (1). The density of these lesions varies depending upon injury maturity; hyperattenuating in earlier stages and becoming more hypoattenuating with time (1). Slight mass affect on the adjacent renal cortex may also be recognized (1). When the renal capsule is injured whether by blunt trauma or penetrating injury (as in this case by means of a biopsy needle), hematoma can enter the perinephric space (1). Hemorrhage in the perinephric space, when limited, appears similar to the subcapsular hematoma but demonstrates more ragged and heterogeneous margins.   \n\nMost subcapsular hematomas are managed conservatively (1). Only life threatening hemorrhage and impending circulatory collapse will prompt surgical exploration (1). \n\nThis patient was admitted to the hospital over night for close observation, following which he was discharged home with no untoward effects. \n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

The specific etiology of sarcoidosis has not yet been identified, but it likely the combination of environmental and genetic factors. Events are triggered by an unknown factor with activation of pulmonary T cells and pulmonary alveolar macrophages. T cells proliferate in the lungs and release chemotactic factors which attract monocytes into the lungs, increasing the macrophage response which in turn leads to proliferation of fibroblasts with promotion of collagen synthesis and eventual fibrosis. Hypercalcemia and elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme are seen secondary to activation of pulmonary alveolar macrophages.  Hypercalcemia can lead to nephrocalcinosis. T cell changes in the lungs are not seen in the peripheral circulation where there is lymphopenia.  Manifestations are also seen in other organ systems. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is present in about 80% cases and is often asymptotic but may be associated with dull ache, malaise and fever. Generalized lymphadenopathy may occur in about 10%. Nervous system involvement includes cranial nerve palsies and neuropathy.  The eyes can be involved with uveitits and keratoconjuctivivits.  Skeletal manifestations include phalangeal cysts and arthritis.  The heart can be affected with cardiomyopathy and associated heart block.  In the united stated, sarcoid is more common in blacks. In blacks, the skin, joints, and eyes are more often involved.   Additionally, manifestation of the disease tends to be more florid in blacks.  \n\nRadiographic findings: Plain film CXR abnormalities are found in over 90% of patients.  Bilateral hilar adenopathy is most common, oftentimes with right paratracheal and AP window adenopathy. Subcarinal nodes are less common. Lymph nodes can calcify, usually in an amorphous, popcorn-like fashion.  Nodal calcification is related to duration of disease. Sarcoid causes interstitial lung disease, which can have a variety of appearances: a reticulo-nodular pattern is the most common and is typically bilateral and symmetric. An alveolar pattern with small indistinct nodular opacities can be seen but is actually the result of interstitial lung disease.\nCT is more sensitive in the detection of adenopathy and parenchymal lung disease.  HRCT is used to evaluate for parenchymal lung disease demonstrating nodular peribronchiovascular thickening.  Similar changes may be noted along the fissures.  Nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter are actually the result of coalescence of small nodules. Areas of ground glass attenuation can be seen resulting from microscopic interstitial granulomas. CT appearance does not correspond well to patient’s pulmonary state. Sarcoid can lead to end stage fibrosis, which is indistinguishable from other causes.  \nAbdominal involvement includes liver involvement which most commonly produces hepatomegaly, but can result in focal nodules.  Additionally, hypodense splenic nodules can be found.  Intra-abdominal adenopathy can be seen in nearly a 3rd of patients.  Nephrolithiasis can be seen from hypercalcemia. Skeletal findings tend to involve the small bones of the hands with associated skin changes. Findings include a lace-like reticular pattern or cystic lesions. The bone lesions are hot on bone scan and FDG PET imaging. \nCardiac changes can include thinning of the myocardium seen on CT.  On MRI, there can be areas of increased MRI T2 signal intensity and areas of T-1 contrast enhancement.\n\nStaging/prognosis: Staging is based upon the CXR findings. Stage 0- Normal CXR; Stage 1- Mediastinal/ Hilar adenopathy; Stage 2- Adenopathy plus parenchymal infiltrates; Stage 3- Lung infiltrates only; and Stage 4- Fibrosis/ Cystic changes. Prognosis is directly correlated with the patients staging.   Sarcoid will resolve in over half of stage 1 patients.  Overall, about 20% of affected patients will progress to pulmonary fibrosis with 5% mortality.\n\nTreatment: Usually no treatment is necessary. Spontaneous remission occurs in 90% of patients with stage 1 pulmonary disease and half of patients with stage 2.  If chest x-rays showed persistent pulmonary infiltration with associated decreased serial lung functions oral steroids are used.  In patients who are unresponsive to steroids, other medications such as azathioprine or cyclosporin may be useful.   Chloroquine is used as a steroid sparing agent in patients with severe skin disease.", "keywords": "SarcoidLymphadenopathygranuloma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1152_synpic20557"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1152_synpic20557", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1152_synpic20557.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Generalized", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "CT guided biopsy of retroperitoneal node.", "age": "34", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "8.6", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n34 year old female presents to the emergency room with abdominal pain.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nPE: Mild bilateral flank pain.\nLabs: Elevated serum calcium.\n\nImaging Findings:\n1.

It is composed of variable amounts of fat and hematopoietic tissue, including myeloid and erythroid cells and megakaryocytes.  The imaging appearance is based on the fat content of this lesion.  Thus they appear echogenic on US, low attenuation on CT and hyperintense on T1 weighted in phase MR images. The etiology is unclear, but myelolipoma may be a result of metaplasia of cells in the adrenal, possibly myeloid cells misplaced during embryogenesis. It affects men and women equally. Although this is a nonfunctioning tumor, in 10% it is associated with endocrine disorders, including Cushing syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Conn syndrome. Most myelolipomas (80%) are asymptomatic and are of no clinical significance. Some (10%) become large and cause vague symptoms or pain. Large myelolipomas may hemorrhage, which can be the cause of pain. Size ranges from 1 to 15 cm, with a mean of about 4 cm. \n\nOn CT, most myelolipomas are well-circumscribed masses. Nearly all contain some definite fat density (<-20 HU). However, the amount of fat is widely variable, ranging from nearly all fat, to more than half fat (50%), to only a few tiny foci of fat in a soft-tissue mass (10%).  Occasionally, the mass has an attenuation value between that of fat and water because the fat and myeloid elements are diffusely mixed. Calcification is seen in 30%, often punctate. With hemorrhage, high density areas can be seen. Bilateral myelolipomas occur in about 10%. \n\nThe presence of fat in an adrenal mass is the key to the diagnosis of myelolipoma, because virtually no other adrenal lesion contains fat. Teratoma and liposarcoma of the adrenals are extraordinarily rare.  Macroscopic fat on CT (HU= -30 to -110), usually obviates the need for biopsy, but if necessary (i.e. extra-adrenal location which may then mimic a liposarcoma), diagnosis can be confirmed by percutaneous needle sampling.

Typical locations include on the ovaries (76%), anterior and posterior cul-de-sac (69%), posterior broad ligament (47%), uterosacral ligament (36%), uterus (11%), colon (4%) and small bowel (0.5%). Women of childbearing age are affected and the mean age of diagnosis is 25-29. The overall prevalence of endometriosis in woman is estimated to be 5-10%. Clinical manifestations include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, abdominal pain, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and infertility.  Small implants and adhesions are not well evaluated radiologically; therefore, laparoscopy remains the standard of reference for diagnosis and staging.  \n\nAn endometrioma may be defined as an area of endometriosis, usually in the ovary, that has enlarged sufficiently to be classified as a tumor or cyst.  It develops secondary to a deep endometriotic implant that undergoes repeated hemorrhage. It can completely replace normal ovarian tissue.  If large enough to see by ultrasound the mass typically has homogenous low-level echoes -- a non-specific appearance which can also be seen with entities such as hemorrhagic cysts and malignancy. A recent study (Patel et al) noted that 95% of endometriomas in their study exhibited this typical appearance on ultrasound. Although endometriomas frequently contain septations, the absence of wall nodularity and presence of diffuse low level echoes favors endometrioma over malignancy.  The appearance of endometriomas can mimic neoplasm including wall thickening, septations, wall nodularity and echogenic wall foci.   Detection of endometriosis implants and adhesions by ultrasound is not practical due to their small size and large variety of appearances.   Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic cysts, dermoid cysts and cystic neoplasms.   Resolution of a cystic lesion on a follow-up ultrasound effectively rules out endometrioma.  Because of the wide variability of ultrasound appearance of endometriomas pelvic MRI can be very helpful. \n\nThe appearance of endometriomas on MRI is more specific than other non-invasive imaging methods.  Imaging planes can include all three standard projections (axial, sagittal, and coronal), with the sagittal plane being particularly useful for evaluating the cul-de-sac and rectum. Endometriomas appear hyperintense on T1-weighted images.  On T2 weighted images they display heterogenous “shading” or loss of signal intensity compared with T1 weighted images which is due to the chronic cyclical nature of its blood products and helps differentiate it from other lesions with more acute hemorrhage. The findings on T2 weighted sequence are variable and depend on the concentration of blood products.   Fat suppression increases the conspicuity of endometriomas and allows more detailed evaluation of their architecture.  This is especially helpful in differentiating endometriomas from fat-containing lesions such as dermoid cysts.  Gadolinium iv contrast enhancement is not particularly useful for differentiating endometriomas from other lesions as endometriomas have non-specific variable enhancement. Dermoids can be recognized and differentiated from endometriomas by the presence of chemical shift artifact and signal drop-out on the fat-suppression images. Mucinous lesions can have increased signal intensity on T1-weighted but their signal is considerably less intense than that of fat or blood.  Hemorrhagic cysts can have similar T1 characteristics, but will not demonstrate T2 “shading” and can be differentiated from endometriomas when they resolve over time.

Its etiology is unknown; however, the most widely accepted theory is that it is a developmental abnormality of mesenchyme in which osteoblasts fail to undergo normal morphologic differentiation and maturation.  The medullary cavity is filled with fibrous tissue in which trabeculae of poorly calcified primitive new bone are developed by osseous metaplasia.  Both sexes are equally affected.  It begins early in life, often in infancy, but being frequently asymptomatic it usually remains unrecognized until adulthood.\n\nFibrous dysplasia is not hereditary, and it may involve one or many bones.  The polyostotic variety and rarely the monostotic type when associated with endocrine dysfunction, typically manifested by precocious female sexual development and cutaneous pigmentation, is known as the McCune-Albright syndrome.\n\nFibrous dysplasia may be associated with either solitary or multiple lesions, in one or more bones.  Approximately 70-80% of cases are monostotic, 20-30% are polyostotic, and 2-3% are associated with endocrinopathies.  Abnormal cutaneous pigmentation, which is the most common extraskeletal manifestation of fibrous dysplasia, is evident in more than half of patients with polyostotic disease and is almost always present in those with both multiple bone lesions and endocrine dysfunction.  However, it is quite infrequently seen with monostotic lesions.  Monostotic fibrous dysplasia is most frequently encountered in a rib, femur, tibia, calvarium and humerus in order of decreasing frequency, however, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia more frequently involves the skull and facial bones, pelvis, spine and shoulder girdle.\n\nInvolvement of the skull and the facial bones is noted in approximately 10-25% of patients with monostotic fibrous dysplasia and in 50% of those with polyostotic involvement.  Common areas of involvement in the skull include the frontal, sphenoid, maxillary and ethmoid bones; the occipital and temporal bones are affected less commonly.\n\nRoutine radiographs commonly reveal single or multiple, symmetric or asymmetric radiolucent or sclerotic lesions in the skull and facial bones or both.  Profound and often extensive sclerosis tends to predominate in the skull and particularly affects its base and the sphenoid wings.\n\nHazy radiolucent lesions which are usually the most common manifestation of fibrous dysplasia are often associated with widened diploic spaces and expansion in the skull and facial bones.  The osseous expansion is focal or widespread and is almost always in an outward direction.  The outer table of the vault is invariably convex, whereas both tables remain essentially intact rather than destroyed as is the case frequently with Paget's disease.  Another manifestation in the cranial vault represents variable sized, localized, relatively radiolucent zones which when surrounded by a sclerotic rim may have a doughnut shape.

However, they can be seen at any age, and there is no gender or racial predilection. \n\nTypical symptoms include pathologic fracture or bone pain both of which our patient did not have. Often times, patients are asymptomatic. Prognosis is usually benign and cases are managed conservatively.  Malignant transformation is extremely rare (<1%) but signs include bone scalloping, cortical thickening, periosteal reaction, bony erosion all of which can be seen on imaging.", "topic_title": "Enchondroma", "acr_code": "4.3", "category": "Neoplasm, benign", "disease_discussion": "A benign neoplasm composed of ectopic cartilage rests that have migrated into bones’ metaphysis from the growth plate. Enchondromas are usually singular, but multiple lesions may occur in enchondromatosis syndromes such as Ollier’s, Maffucci’s and metachondromatosis.  Enchondromas are a benign finding seen incidentally on plain radiographs MRI, and/or CT while investigating other pathology.\n\nTypically, patients are 20-40 years old when the tumor is identified.  The patient with any of the enchondromatosis syndromes is typically younger when the first lesion is identified. There is no gender or racial predilection.\n\nIn the United States, enchondromas account for 12-14% of benign bone neoplasms and 3-10% of osseous neoplasms in general. They are most commonly found in the diaphyses of the hands and feet, and less commonly in the femur, humerus, or tibia.  Enchondromas present as small (<5 cm) lytic masses which have a pattern of lobulated arcs and rings indicative of their chondroid matrix.  When found in the larger bones, they are usually metaphyseal, centrally located and can have a sclerotic margin.\n\nFrequently plain radiographs are adequate to identify and diagnose enchondromas.  Occasionally, further imaging such as CT or MRI may be required to offer a more complete picture of the bone surrounding the tumor.  Bone scans are usually ineffective in the diagnosis of enchondromas as typical findings of mildly increased uptake are non-specific.\n\nEnchondromas are benign but can cause pathologic fractures or can rarely progress to chondrosarcoma. This malignant transformation is of concern due to the destructive changes which occur in high grade tumors as well as the 5 year survival rate which is as low as 15% in high grade tumors.   \n\nTumors found in the hands and feet have a virtually negligible transformation rate while those seen in the long and flat bones should be monitored more closely for transformation. Transformation to malignancy occurs much more frequently in patients with enchondromatosis. \n\nThe following radiographic changes are suggestive of this transformation to chondrosarcoma:\n• \tScalloping of the inner surface of the bone\n• \tThickening of the bone cortex\n• \tReactive bone growth on the outer surface of the bone\n• \tErosion surrounded by reactive bone\n• \tNoticeable growth in the bony erosion\n• \tMRI may identify cortical extension and extension to the soft tissue mass.\n\nWith the exception of enlarged digits when hands and feet are involved, physical exam of the patient with an enchondroma is usually unremarkable. Pain found on exam is attributable to either adjacent but non-related pathology, pathologic fracture resulting from the enchondroma, or should raise the clinical suspicion for progression to chondrosarcoma.\n\nDifferential diagnosis varies depending on whether calcifications are present.  In cases in which they are, bone infarct which may exhibit a serpiginous lining and low grade chondrosarcoma must be considered.  If the lesion is purely lytic, however, non-ossifying fibroma, simple bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, eosinophilic granuloma, and clear cell chondrosarcoma should be considered. \nWhen considering these diagnoses, the following factors are each used to rule out the diagnosis in question:\n• \tNon-ossifying fibroma – usually cortically based, enchondromas are medullary based\n• \tSimple bone cyst – usually seen before age 20\n• \tEosinophilic granuloma – also seen commonly in patients before age 20\n• \tFibrous dysplasia – has a ground glass appearance on imaging\n• \tClear cell chondrosarcoma – epiphyseally based, with extension into the metaphysis usually seen on MR\n\nWhen asymptomatic, treatment of enchondromas consists of observation.

Physical exam with complete tears classically demonstrates suprapatellar swelling, a palpable defect in the suprapatellar region with tenderness, a low-riding patella, and decreased active range of motion and strength of knee extension.  Partial tears are often much more difficult to discern clinically and as such may be easily misdiagnosed as a \"knee sprain.\"\n\nImaging modalites such as plain radiography and MRI are often used to support the clinical findings.  Findings that suggest quadriceps tear on plain radiographs include suprapatellar soft tissue swelling and distortion of the typical fat planes, and patella baja (inferiorly positioned patella).  Due to the fact the injury commonly occurs at the tendinous insertion site at the patella, avulsion fractures of the patella may also be seen.  MRI demonstrates disruption of the normal low intensity quadriceps tendon on T2 weighted images, which is replaced by high intensity fluid signal secondary to inflammatory response and edema.  Ultrasound is another modality that may be used to demonstrate quadriceps tendon tears.  However, unlike MRI, ultrasound will not demonstrate secondary associated findings often seen in traumatic injuries to the knee such as ligamentous and osteochondral insults, and as such is used much less frequently.\n\nPartial tears are treated conservatively, typically with a 1-2 month peroid of immobilization in full knee extesion, followed by a course of physical therapy to restore range of motion and strength.  Complete tears are usually treated with early surgical intervention which again is followed by a course of immobilization and physical therapy.", "keywords": "quadricepstearrupture", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1737_synpic52862", "MPX1737_synpic52863", "MPX1737_synpic52864", "MPX1737_synpic52865", "MPX1737_synpic52866", "MPX1737_synpic52867"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52862", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52862.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2a"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52863", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52863.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2b"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52864", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52864.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2c"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52865", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52865.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2d"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52866", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52866.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2e"}, {"image_id": "MPX1737_synpic52867", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1737_synpic52867.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Joint effusion", "age": "52", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "4.4", "figure_part": "2f"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n52 y/o male with swollen painful knee and weakness in extension s/p fall\n\nPhysical Exam:\nMarked swelling superior aspect of joint.

Many patients describe this as \"the worst headache of my life\".  There may be associated neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and possibly obtundation or coma.\n\nPhysical examination may show retinal hemorrhages, nuchal rigidity, or focal neurological signs. An altered level of consciousness is seen in approximately one third of patients while meningeal irritation signs are seen in up to 85% of patients and virtually all have nausea.   Kernig sign is pain elicited by straightening the knee with the thigh flexed at the hip.  Brudzinski sign is pain and/or ridgidity with simultaneous neck and knee/hip flexion.   \n\nThe differential diagnosis of a thunder clap headache includes aneurysm thrombosis without rupture, “leakage” into an aneurysm wall, aneurysm rupture with subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral vein/dural venous sinus thrombosis, localized meningeal inflammation, nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, first or worst migraine headache attack, benign exertional headache, and benign thunderclap headache [no associated subarachnoid hemorrhage]. Since early recognition and surgery may benefit patients with aneurysm rupture, all patients with thunderclap headache require evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage. In North America, 75% to 90% of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is caused by aneurysm rupture.  \n\nThe primary diagnostic modalities in the evaluation of subarachnoid hemorrhage include noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan and, if negative, a lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spectrophotometry. The probability of detecting subarachnoid hemorrhage of CT scans performed at various intervals after the ictus is: day 0, 95%; day 3, 74%; day 7, 50%; day 14, 30%; and day 21, almost zero.  It is important to note that the sensitivity of CT in detecting subarachnoid hemorrhage decreases with time, and may miss up to 5% of cases even in the first 12 hours after symptom onset.\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging is not as sensitive in the detection of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and does not usually play a role in the initial diagnostic evaluation.  MR findings include alteration of CSF (reduced diffusion and bright CSF on DWI, bright on FLAIR). CT has greater availability, lower expense, and faster scanning times. \n\nAcute subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as high attenuation on noncontrast CT within the subarachnoid spaces.  Blood will insinuate within the sulci over the cerebral convexities as it mixes with CSF. A focal cisternal or parenchymal hemorrhage may suggest the location of a ruptured aneurysm - although this localization is often postural. Focal anterior interhemispheric blood may be due to an anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture. Blood in the sylvian fissure may be due to a middle cerebral artery, internal carotid artery terminus, or posterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture. Posterior communicating artery aneurysms may be associated with third cranial nerve palsies and often bleed into the temporal lobe. Posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms often bleed into the fourth ventricle.\n\nNonthrombosed aneurysms may be seen as a well delineated, isodense to slightly hyperdense mass located somewhat eccentrically in the suprasellar cistern or sylvian fissure. \n\nAfter detection of subarachnoid hemorrhage by either CT or lumbar puncture the evaluation can proceed directly to a four vessel catheter angiogram.  At some institutions, however, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the head is the preferred next step.   Several studies have shown that CTA is excellent at detecting aneurysms larger than 3 mm. When a CTA adequately demonstrates an aneurysm, patients can proceed to definitive treatment without a catheter angiogram.  In some institutions, catheter angiograms are preferred to CTA, and are always the next step for patients in whom no aneurysm is detected on CTA or in patients with aneurysms amenable to endovascular intervention by coils or balloon occlusion.\n\nApproximately 90% of all intracranial aneurysms arise from the anterior (carotid) cerebral circulation while 10% arise from the posterior (vertebrobasilar) circulation. The most common locations are the anterior communicating artery (35%), posterior communicating artery origin (30%), middle cerebral artery bifurcation or trifurcation (25%), basilar artery tip (5%), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and other sites distal to the circle of Willis (5%). Up to 30% of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have multiple intracranial aneurysms, that may present in \"mirror image\" locations. Patent aneurysms are seen as a contrast filled outpouching from the vessel wall on angiography. Ruptured aneurysms typically have an irregular or lobulated appearance.  Localized vasospasm and subarachnoid hemorrhage are also helpful signs of aneurysm rupture, particularly in those patients with multiple aneurysms.\n\nRisk factors for development of intracranial aneurysms include numerous connective tissue disorders and account for approximately 5% of cases.  Associated conditions include:  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, hypertension, aortic coarctation, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Other etiologies include drug abuse (cocaine), infection (mycotic aneurysms), neoplasm, or trauma. \n\nIn approximately 15-30% of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, no aneurysm is found despite a complete four vessel cerebral angiogram. These patients fall into two distinct subsets: a nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage pattern and an “aneurysmal” pattern. In the first (perimesencephalic) subset, the hemorrhage is typically anterior to the brainstem and within the interpeduncular fossa or ambient cisterns and is thought to result from rupture of small pontine or perimesencephalic veins.\n\nIn the second subset of patients, subarachnoid hemorrhage fills the suprasellar cistern and extends into the sylvian or anterior interhemispheric fissures. Patients with an aneurysmal pattern of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage are at risk for rebleeding, cerebral ischemia, and neurological deficit Repeat four-vessel cerebral angiography demonstrates an aneurysm in 5% to 10% of these cases. Non-identification of the aneurysm on the first angiogram may be secondary to local vasospasm with incomplete filling of the aneurysm. \n\nAcute subarachnoid hemorrhage carries a mortality rate of 25% in the first 24 hours and 50% within three months. Causes of sudden death include a large intraparenchymal hematoma, destruction of brain tissue, acute hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory failure. Of the patients that reach a major medical center the leading causes of death are the sequelae of the initial hemorrhage, recurrent aneurysmal rupture and vasospasm with ischemic stroke. While the potential complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage are extensive, the primary goal of medical management is to address the leading causes of death by trying to prevent vasospasm and recurrent hemorrhage. \n\nVasospasm typically occurs seven days (5-10 days) after the subarachnoid hemorrhage, and is prevented predominantly via administration of a calcium channel blocker such as nimodipine, which decreases blood pressure but increases cerebral blood flow. Maintaining adequate hydration is also important. Transcranial Doppler evaluation is helpful in monitoring for the development of vasospasm by detecting elevated intracranial arterial velocities. This is seen most frequently in the distal internal carotid artery and the proximal portions of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, regardless of the location of the aneurysm rupture.  Once vasospasm occurs, medical therapy is aimed at increasing cerebral blood flow, predominantly with volume expansion and drug-induced hypertension. Transluminal angioplasty is extremely successful in dilating vasospastic arteries.\n\nThe prevention of recurrent hemorrhage, which is highest immediately after the initial subarachnoid hemorrhage, is through early surgical or endovascular treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Endovascular therapy with platinum coils was introduced in 1990 as an alternative to surgical clipping. The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) demonstrated a significant risk reduction with endovascular therapy over surgery for ruptured aneurysms amenable to either therapy. Endovascular treatment is particularly useful in posterior circulation aneurysms, such as a basilar tip aneurysm, in which the surgical approach is extremely difficult.  With the exception of difficult access to posterior circulation aneurysms, surgical clipping is an effective and definitive treatment modality of ruptured aneurysms. Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage should be evaluated in treatment centers that offer both neurosurgery and neuroendovascular treatment, allowing the neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists to assess the advantages and disadvantages of clipping or coiling for each individual patient.\n\nIn summary, nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most common secondary cause of the worst headache of life and 75% to 90% of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is caused by aneurysm rupture. Since early diagnosis and treatment of aneurysm rupture may improve the patient’s outcome, all patients presenting with the worst headache of life require evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage with a noncontrast CT scan and a lumbar puncture if the CT scan is negative. Once subarachnoid hemorrhage is detected, either a CT angiogram or a catheter angiogram should be performed, preferably at a facility with both interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons. This allows the patient to undergo aneurysm coiling or clipping and be appropriately managed for common complications such as vasospasm or recurrent hemorrhage.", "keywords": "subarachnoid hemorrhageaneurysmthunderclap", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1397_synpic31411"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1397_synpic31411", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1397_synpic31411.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Dense subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar and basilar cisterns, as well as along the tentorium.

It is likely multifactoral including  genetic influence, dysfunctional immune response, enteric normal flora bacteria, and other environmental factors.  It is believed to be the result of an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Most cases involve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Crohn disease typically affects the bowel asymmetrically, involving the mesenteric side more severely than the antimesenteric border. Although any area of the GI system may be affected, the most common site of disease is the ileo-cecal region, followed by the colon.  Microscopically, the initial lesion appears as a focal inflammatory infiltrate around the crypts, followed by ulceration of superficial mucosa, then by deeper invasion and non-caseating granulomas. Grossly, the early abnormality is hyperemia and edema of the involved mucosa. Later, superficial ulcers form, which become deep serpentine linear ulcers located both longitudinally and transversely giving the mucosa a “cobblestone” appearance. The lesions are often segmental; being separated by healthy areas, hence the term “skip lesions”. Transmural inflammation results in thickening of the bowel wall and narrowing of the lumen. As the disease progresses, it is complicated by obstruction, fistula formation, abscess formation, adhesions, and malabsorption.\n\nClinical: The characteristic presentation of Crohn disease is with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which may be complicated by intestinal fistula formation, obstruction, or both. Unpredictable flares and remissions with a long course characterize Crohn’s. Treatment is generally medical including antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, and sometimes antibiotics. Chronic complications include fistulas, adhesions, and marked luminal narrowing with partial bowel obstruction which may require surgery.\n\nRadiographic findings:\nRadiological evaluation includes diagnosis, evaluation of distribution, and evaluation for complications. The distribution of small bowel Crohn’s disease is best assessed by enteroclysis and CT. The terminal ileum is nearly always involved in small bowel disease and is the only site in up 30 % of patients.\n  \nSmall bowel contrast studies: The sensitivity of enteroclysis is reported as very good in detecting Crohn’s disease but often does not correlate well with disease activity. Superficial abnormalities include thickened folds due to mucosal edema, transverse and longitudinal ulcers, punctate collections of barium, and small nodules. Transmural abnormalities include deep fissures and penetrating ulcers.  Cobblestoning results from intersecting longitudinal and transverse ulcers with intervening heaped-up edematous tissue.  Deep ulcerations may result in fistulae. Thickened bowel may appear as separations of loops. Luminal narrowing is always present resulting from spasm and edema during the acute phase or fibrotic strictures in chronic disease. Ileitis can also manifest as a “sting sign” on barium study secondary to spasm or fibrotic stricture fromation.  The mesenteric aspect and adjacent mesentery are commonly affected more than the antimesenteric border. Extramural mesenteric inflammation and abscesses may induce compression and displacement of bowel loops.\n\nCross sectional imaging: Both CT and MR imaging are reported to have a sensitivity of over 95% for the detection of Crohn disease.  At more advanced stages, CT and MR imaging can help identify and characterize pathologically altered bowel segments as well as extraluminal lesions including abscesses, fat stranding, and adenopathy.

They may be found in intracranial and intraspinal compartments.  In the head, meningiomas are most commonly located in frontal, parasagittal, and parietal convexities (50% of cases). Less than 10% of tumors are infratentorial; multiple meningiomas occur less than 10% of the time.  Clinical presentation is varied, depending on particular structures compressed by the mass. Headache and visual changes are frequently reported.  A large number of patients with meningiomas are asymptomatic.\n\nOrigins, Growth, and Histology\nThe majority of meningiomas are histologically benign tumors, arising from the cap cells of the arachnoid layer. In many cases, serial imaging studies have revealed a cessation of growth after the time of initial tumor detection. These tumors project inward from the dura, and can cause clinically significant effects due to compression of surrounding neurological structures.  A variety of classification systems based on cytology and histopathology are used with meningiomas.  While the overwhelming majority of meningiomas are histologically benign, the malignant type may result in rapid, widespread infiltration with small (microscopic) \"finger\" projections into adjacent cortex.  In patients with malignant meningiomas, marked deficits in physical and mental status may culminate in death.\n\nRadiological Findings\nPlain films may reveal hyperostosis, erosion, or calcification adjacent to tumor site.  Noncontrast CT's of meningiomas often reveal sharply demarcated, rounded, homogenous masses with slightly increased density when compared to surrounding cortex.  Up to 10% of meningiomas may appear isodense with respect to surrounding brain.  CT may reveal focal cerebral atrophy, edema, or widening of subarachnoid spaces, direct effects of tumor compression of surrounding structures.  Contrast enhanced CT most often reveals homogenous enhancement in approximately 85% of cases.\n\nOn MRI, T1 images are often hypo- or isointense; T2 images often reveal isointense or slightly hyperintense masses. Gadolinium increases signal intensity of meningiomas. A  \"dural tail\" consisting of tissue tapering into the dura may be appreciated.  Imaging studies may reveal extension of mass into cortical structures, or invasion of the calvarium. Angiography often reveals a homogenous, hypervascular pattern.\n\n\nTreatment Options\nA variety of clinical and experimental treatment options exist, including surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.  Resection is the most widely utilized treatment option, although advanced age, concern about loss of neurological function due to surgery, advanced age, and being a poor surgical candidate preclude some from surgical options. Tumor embolization may be employed 3-5 days prior to surgery in an attempt to decrease blood supply to the meningioma. Recurrence of tumor is a possibility after resection. Complete removal of initial tumor and all affected bone results in recurrence rates of less than 10%.\n\nRadiotherapy is often employed during the presurgical period.  Likewise radiotherapy after incomplete resection of a meningioma may be of considerable benefit to patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery with a \"gamma knife\" has shown decrease in tumor size in approximately 50% of cases.  Since this technology is relatively new, long term outcome of gamma knife therapy is not known. Brachytherapy with iodine-125 has been described in the literature; long term outcomes have yet to be determined. Medical treatment options include recommendations of anticonvulsant prophylaxis in patients with supratentorial masses; corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling may also be warranted.  The use of traditional antineoplastic agents in treating meningiomas has not been met with great success.  Hormonal manipulation may have a beneficial effect on stopping tumor growth; research this area continues.", "keywords": "", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2142_synpic20378", "MPX2142_synpic20379", "MPX2142_synpic20380", "MPX2142_synpic20381"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2142_synpic20378", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2142_synpic20378.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T1WI: hypointense to isointense circumscribed extraaxial mass located midline over the planum sphenoidale.", "age": "39", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": "1"}, {"image_id": "MPX2142_synpic20379", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2142_synpic20379.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W w/Gadolinium", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "post Gad T1WI: intensely enhancing circumscribed extraaxial mass located midline over the planum sphenoidale.", "age": "39", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": "2"}, {"image_id": "MPX2142_synpic20380", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2142_synpic20380.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T2 weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "T2WI: centrally nectotic circumscribed extraaxial mass located midline over the planum sphenoidale.", "age": "39", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": "3"}, {"image_id": "MPX2142_synpic20381", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2142_synpic20381.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W w/Gadolinium", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "post Gad T1WI: centrally nectotic circumscribed extraaxial mass located midline over the planum sphenoidale.", "age": "39", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": "4"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n39 year-old woman with several month history of bilateral hemianopsia, worse in the morning\n\nPhysical Exam:\nseveral month history of bilateral hemianopsia\n\nImaging Findings:\nLarge cicrumscribed midline mass overlying the planum sphenoidale causing \"cortical buckling\" of adjacent brain parenchyma.

As the tibia and femur return to their normal position, the lateral femoral condyle impacts the posterolateral tibial plateau resulting in an osteochondral impaction fracture of the lateral femoral condyle.\n\nThe radiograph will demonstrate an irregular asymmetric appearing notch that is greater than 2 mm in depth. This is referred to as the “deep lateral femoral sulcus” sign. The depth of the notch is measured by drawing a line tangential to the sulcus along the articular surface of the lateral femoral condyle and then by measuring the distance from the line to the depth of the sulcus (Fig 5). The presence of a deep lateral femoral sulcus is nearly always associated with ACL disruption but lacks sensitivity; the absence of the sign therefore does not exclude the presence of an ACL tear (5).\n\nMR imaging also demonstrates an irregular appearing deep lateral femoral sulcus and in addition it will demonstrate marrow edema within the lateral femoral condyle and the posterior tibial plateau secondary to the impaction injury (6). This pattern of marrow edema has been referred to as the “pivot shift” marrow edema pattern and is also highly specific for ACL injury. See figures 2, 3 and 4 for examples in our case. MR imaging will demonstrate the ACL disruption along with associated injuries of internal derangement to include meniscal tear, chondral injury and collateral ligament tear.\n\nThe “deep lateral femoral sulcus” sign is a subtle radiographic finding that when present on a plain film can provide an important clue that an ACL injury has occurred. It results from an impaction of the lateral femoral condyle against the posterior tibial plateau at the time of ACL disruption. Identification of this finding on radiographs of the knee should prompt further evaluation of the knee with MR imaging.", "keywords": "Anterior cruciate ligament disruptionDeep lateral femoral notch", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2300_synpic31225", "MPX2300_synpic31226", "MPX2300_synpic31227"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2300_synpic31225", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2300_synpic31225.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - Other Pulse Seq.", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Sagittal STIR image through the lateral femoral condyle demonstrate a deep irregular appearing lateral femoral sulcus.

The most significant risk factors for development of HCC include cirrhosis and hepatitis B or C infection. Other less common risk factors include hemochromatosis, aflatoxin exposure and alpha-1-antiprotease deficiency.\n\nClinical presentation: Patients often present with cachexia, weakness, right upper quadrant pain, and weight loss. HCC should be suspected in previously stable cirrhosis patients who experience a sudden deterioration in their condition.\n\nPhysical examination: The physician may find an enlarged and tender liver, palpable mass, and bruit or friction rub.\n\nLaboratory: A sudden and sustained elevation in AFP is suggestive of HCC.\n\nRadiographic evaluation:\n\n\tCT: HCC can present as a solitary mass, multiple masses with a dominant lesion and satellites or as a diffusely infiltrating neoplasm. The masses can be characterized as areas of low attenuation. Ten percent of tumors will show calcification. Dual phase imaging in arterial and portal venous phases may be necessary to detect the tumor. These tumors commonly invade blood vessels such as portal and hepatic veins. Portal vein thrombosis appears as regional wedge-like shapes of low density that project peripherally. Tumor thrombus will enhance on arterial phase CT images.\n\n\tMRI: MRI findings depend on the amount of fibrosis and necrosis in the liver. HCC can be recognized as low-signal intensity on T1 with an increase in signal intensity on T2. MR demonstrates vascular involvement well.\n\n\tUS: HCC appears as mosaic pattern, peripheral sonolucency with lateral shadow due to fibrotic pseudocapsule, posterior acoustic enhancement.

In the fifth week of normal embryonic development the midgut rapidly elongates, forming the primary intestinal loop. The vascular supply to the midgut, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), serves as the axis for the primary intestinal loop. The primary intestinal loop elongates so rapidly that the abdominal cavity cannot contain the developing midgut; and, as a result, the primary intestinal loop herniates into the umbilical cord. During this herniation, the developing loop rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise about its axis. In the tenth week of development, the intestinal loop returns to the abdominal cavity, rotating an additional 180 degrees counterclockwise. \n\nThe cephalic limb of the primary loop forms the distal duodenum, the jejunum, and the proximal ileum. The caudal limb forms the distal ileum, the cecum, ascending colon, and most of the transverse colon. \n\nThe proximal or pre-arterial midgut returns to the abdominal cavity first and begins to occupy the right side of the abdominal cavity. The proximal midgut becomes fixed to the posterior abdominal wall at the ligament of Treitz.\n\nAs the distal or post-arterial midgut returns to the abdomen, the counterclockwise rotation causes the cecum to initially occupy the right upper quadrant. The rotation is completed as the cecum migrates to the right iliac fossa in the right lower quadrant (RLQ). \n\nThe ascending colon gradually becomes fixed to the posterior abdominal wall, losing its free mesentery. Normal counterclockwise rotation of the midgut results in a wide-based mesentery. In malrotation, the proximal midgut returns to the abdominal cavity with normal rotation, but the distal midgut fails to rotate completely. As a result, the cecum will become fixed to the posterior abdominal wall in the upper abdomen. This position results in a mesentery with a narrow base that is prone to volvulus and midgut ischemia. \n\nPeritoneal bands of fibrosis that fix the cecum to the right lateral abdominal wall (Ladd’s bands) run anterior to the duodenum and may cause compression and obstruction of the duodenum.\n\nSymptomatic malrotation typically presents in infancy or childhood. The acute symptomatic presentation is usually related to duodenal obstruction or midgut ischemia.  Although it is less common, intestinal malrotation may first become symptomatic in adolescence or adulthood. The later onset of symptoms ranges from chronic abdominal pain to acute mesenteric ischemia. Occasionally, malrotation is discovered as an incidental radiographic finding. \n\nThe management of asymptomatic malrotation is controversial. Some authors have suggested that all asymptomatic patients with malrotation should undergo an open or laparoscopic Ladd’s procedure (transaction of Ladd’s bands, counterclockwise reduction of malrotation, and appendectomy). Others have proposed that prophylactic surgical intervention is only indicated in children with asymptomatic malrotation. \n\nThe prevalence of asymptomatic malrotation is unknown. As the use of of computed tomography increases and new abdominal imaging modalities emerge, it is likely that the diagnosis of intestinal malrotation as an incidental finding will become more frequent.", "keywords": "MalrotationVolvulusLadd", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2389_synpic29628", "MPX2389_synpic30345"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2389_synpic29628", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2389_synpic29628.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "Virtual Colonoscopy", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Non-contrast (virtual colonoscopy) CT", "age": "44", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "7.1", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2389_synpic30345", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2389_synpic30345.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "Virtual Colonoscopy", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Virtual colonoscopy coronal reconstruction showing:\n• Loops of small bowel in right hemiabdomen\n• Majority of colon occupying left hemiabdomen\n• Leftward deviation of ascending colon\n• Cecum in anatomical position", "age": "44", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "7.1", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nThis 44 yo man was referred to Radiology for virtual colonoscopy.

The anomaly accounts for 5-10% of all congenital heart defects and shows predominance in males of roughly 1.3 to 2.1 times that of females. When CoA becomes clinically relevant, it can lead to systemic hypertension and secondary left ventricular hypertrophy with heart failure. If it is not treated, the patient’s mean age of death is about 34 years.\n\nCoA can present with other anomalies, most frequently of which is a bicuspid aortic valve, accompanying up to 60-85% of aortic coarctations. Although the true etiology of CoA is still unknown, this high correlation leads to the hypothesis that these two anomalies stem from a common congenital malformation. Due to the relatively high prevalence in males and in patients with Turner’s syndrome, it has also been suggested that a link exists between the X-chromosome and the anomalous aorta and valve.\n\nCoarctation can occur in various locations along the length of the aorta. Stenosis prior to the emergence of the left subclavian artery is infrequent, with most coarctations occurring just distal to the left subclavian artery. Narrowing that occurs in the descending thoracic or abdominal aorta is exceedingly rare. Clinical presentation and symptoms are less related to anatomical position and more related to the degree of stenosis and the presence of associated abnormalities.\n\nCommon symptoms associated with CoA include epistaxis, arterial hypertension, headache, and leg fatigue. In younger male patients CoA should always be considered in differential diagnosis if upper extremity hypertension exists with lower extremity hypotension and weak pulses.\n\nIf a pressure gradient >30 mm Hg is present across the stenosis, surgical treatment should be considered.

The uvea is subdivided into the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroids.  Most choroidal melanomas are believed to develop from preexisting melaanocytic nevi.  The estimated prevalence is five to seven cases per 1 million adults, occurring most commonly in people of northern European descent.  Sixty-five percent of melanomas occur in those older than 50 years.  Patients may be asymptomatic with lesions discovered during a routine ophthalmologic examination.  Other patients may notice vision loss, photopsia, and visual field deficits.  \n\nMelanomas primarily metastasize to the liver, as well as to the lung, bone, kidney, and brain.  Treatment is dependent on site of origin, size, location of the primary lesion, and on the presence of extraocular extension, recurrence, or metastases.  Melanomas greater than 1 cm in thickness are managed with enucleation.  Medium sized lesions (3 mm to 1 cm) may be managed with enucleation, plaque brachytherapy and external-beam radiation.  Small tumors (<3 mm in thickness) are monitored every 3-6 months with US.  \n\nUveal melanomas are usually assessed by ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein angiography, US, CT or MR imaging.  On unenhanced CT, these lesions appear elevated, hyperdense, are sharply marginated, and following contrast administration avidly enhance.  At MR imaging, most melanomas appear as well-defined solid masses that are hyperintense on T1-weighted images, and hypointense on T2-weighted images secondary to the paramagnetic effects of melanin.  Contrast enhanced fat-suppressed MR images are useful to demonstrate scleral invasion, tumor extension to the optic disc, and extraocular invasion.", "keywords": "Uveal MelanomaIntraocular MelanomaChoroidal Melanoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2027_synpic46451", "MPX2027_synpic46452", "MPX2027_synpic46453", "MPX2027_synpic46455", "MPX2027_synpic46456", "MPX2027_synpic46457", "MPX2027_synpic46459", "MPX2027_synpic46460", "MPX2027_synpic46461", "MPX2027_synpic46462", "MPX2027_synpic46463", "MPX2027_synpic46464", "MPX2027_synpic46465"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2027_synpic46451", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2027_synpic46451.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Eye and Orbit", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Contrast enhanced axial and coronal CT images reveal abnormal infiltration and thickening of the right preseptal soft tissues, extending into the right medial canthus.

This rare lesion, known today as a Brodie’s abscess, is a localized type of subacute or chronic pyogenic osteomyelitis. Pathogenesis is due to an insidious bacteremia with septic emboli to a normal or minimally traumatized long bone, often from an infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The lesion is predominant in young males with unfused epiphyseal plates, typically presenting during the second decade of life. Brodie’s abscess is described as a small, eccentric, localized, lytic lesion with surrounding reactive sclerosis. It is characteristically found in the metaphyseal region of long bones of the lower extremity, most commonly in the tibia. The usual presenting complaint is recurrent pain and localized swelling; systemic symptoms are typically absent.\n\nRadiographs of a Brodie’s abscess often demonstrate a localized area of radiolucency with surrounding sclerosis. The lucent region is commonly located in the metaphysis where it may extend to the growth plate by a tortuous channel.  Detection of this focal metaphyseal abscess with involvement of the growth plate is diagnostic for osteomyelitis. Conventional radiographs should be the initial imaging study for evaluating osteomyelitis although, in early osteomyelitis they are usually normal or may show soft tissue swelling or benign periosteal reaction.\n\nBone scans are more sensitive than conventional x-rays for the early detection of osteomyelitis although not as sensitive as MR imaging.  A focal area of radiopharmaceutical uptake at the site of suspected infection would suggest a Brodie’s abscess. Both Brodie’s abscesses and eosinophilic granulomas show radiopharmaceutical uptake and therefore this cannot be used as a distinguishing feature.\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides a greater accuracy in delineating the extent of disease, a more rapid evaluation. Furthermore, MR imaging possesses a high sensitivity in the detection of bone infection. On T1-weighted MR images, subacute osteomyelitis with Brodie’s abscess presents as a low-intensity signal mass with low-signal-intensity rim that becomes a high-intensity signal mass with a thick, low-intensity rim on T2 weighted MR images. The abscess may rarely extend into the cortex and into soft tissues. In addition, the infection may rarely traverse the open growth plate, to involve the epiphysis. Other findings of chronic osteomyelitis include cortical bone thickening, sequestra, sinus tracts to the adjacent soft tissues. Post-contrast MR images show a non-enhancing mass with enhancing periphery.\n\nOn the imaging studies, our patient showed findings consistent with a Brodie’s abscess with additional more unusual findings of extension across the growth plate into the epiphysis and cortical invasion into adjacent soft tissues. Alternate diagnoses in the differential can be excluded by the absence of a lesion 15 months prior to detection in this skeletally immature youth. Histopathologic confirmation with and positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, however, provide definitive diagnosis of a Brodie’s abscess.\n\nTreatment for Brodie’s abscess includes surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy. A sterile abscess may be treated without antibiotics only if there is symptomatic improvement and radiographic regression of the lesion. More aggressive treatment, such debridement followed by bone grafting, may be needed for abscesses that form slightly before or after bone maturation and do not resolve with surgical treatment.", "topic_title": "Multi organism osteomyelitis", "acr_code": "4.2", "category": "Unsure", "disease_discussion": "Osteomyelitis may result from open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue, from hematogenous and local spread from adjacent tissues and as a postoperative complication(1). The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i. e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. \n\nTreatment generally involves clinical evaluation, imaging evaluation for disease extent, laboratory determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.  Localized bone pain, erythema and drainage around the affected area may be present. The cardinal signs of subacute and chronic osteomyelitis include draining sinus tracts, deformity, instability and local signs of impaired vascularity, range of motion and neurologic status. \n\nWhen there is clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis after physical examination and history, baseline radiographs should be performed followed by magnetic resonance imaging when available to define the extent of osteomyelitis and cellulitis. When MRI is not available, bone scans are useful for determining the extent of the infection. Laboratory tests may show leukocytosis (especially in the acute presentation) and elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level may be noted. Blood cultures are positive in as high as one-half of children with acute osteomyelitis. \n\nIn acute osteomyelitis, the radiographs may be negative or may show only soft tissue swelling and periosteal reaction. Evidence of medullary destruction may not appear until approximately two weeks after the onset of infection. Positive radiographic findings, when present include osteolysis, periosteal reaction and sequestra (segments of necrotic bone separated from living bone by granulation tissue). \n\nA bone abscess found during the subacute or chronic stage of hematogenous osteomyelitis is known as a Brodie's abscess.

If an AML is found to be larger than 4 cm, the presenting signs or symptoms are typically hematuria and or flank pain, and the tumor is resected secondary to an increased risk of hemorrhage.

Initially described as a layered pearly tumor of fat containing biliary fat or cholestrin interspersed among sheets of polyhedral cells.  Cholesteatomas actually do not contain fat but are composed of an outer matrix which surrounds layers of desquamated epithelium. The matrix is comprised of differentiated keratinized squamous epithelium in a collagen matrix.\nIncidence:  The incidence of cholesteatomas is unknown, but it is a relatively common reason for otologic surgery. Death from intracranial complications of a cholesteatoma is uncommon, due to early recognition, timely surgical intervention, and supportive antibiotic therapy. Cholesteatomas remain a relatively common cause of permanent, moderate conductive hearing loss in children and adults. \nTypes:  Cholesteatoma may be classified according to presumed etiology into two general categories: congenital and acquired.  Acquired cholesteatomas can be further divided into primary and secondary acquired.  \nCongenital: (2%)  Congenital cholesteatomas are believed to arise from embryonal inclusions or rests of epithelial cells in the middle ear, mastoid, or petrous bone.  Applies only to cholesteatomas in patients with the following criteria: an intact tympanic membrane, no continuity with the external ear canal,  and lack of etiological factor, i.e.  tympanic membrane perforation, history of ear infections or Eustachian tube dysfunction.\nAcquired: 98%\n1.\tPrimary Acquired: most common type; arises from retraction of the superior pars flaccida (Prussak's space) of the tympanic membrane which results in the formation of an epithelial pocket.  \n2.\tSecondary Acquired:  due to chronic infection and perforation of the pars tensa which results in trapping of epithelial cells within the middle ear.  \n\nPathogenesis:  Several pathogenic mechanisms have been produced to explain the development of acquired cholesteatomas,  however, in all types the keratinizing squamous epithelium has spread beyond its normal location.\n\tThe pathogenesis of primary cholesteatoma is poorly understood.  \tIt is believed that infection/inflammation, TM or Eustachian tube dysfunction, leads to retraction of the tympanic membrane, usually in the region of the superior pars flaccida in Prussak's space.  This retraction results in an epithelial-lined pocket that becomes sealed and subsequently expands b/c of progressive accumulation of epithelial debris, extending posteriorly through the aditus and antrum to the mastoid air cells.  Extension also occurs along the posterior tympanic recesses and petrous apex.\n\tSecondary acquired cholesteatoma is believed to occur via implantation of squamous epithelium into the middle ear as a result of TM perforation (iatrogenic vs traumatic).  Another mechanism is via metaplasia of the cuboidal epithelium of the middle ear to keratinized stratified squamous epithelium due to chronic or recurrent otitis media.  \n\nPathophysiology:\n\tCholesteatomas enlarge with fairly typical patterns of growth.  The most common locations from which cholesteatoma arise are the posterior epitympanum, the posterior mesotympanum and the anterior epitympanum.  Cholesteatomas are channeled along characteristic pathways by surrounding mucosal folds, the middle ear ossicles, and their suspensory ligaments.    \n\tCholesteatomas may grow and cause  primarily bony erosion of the following:\n\t\tScutum\n\t\tOssicles\n\t\tMastoid air cells\n\t\tTegmen\n\t\tSigmoid sinus plate\n\t\tFacial nerve canal\n\t\tLateral semicircular canal wall\n\n\tExtensive disease may result in:  meningitis, abscess, venous sinus thrombosis, CSF rhinorrhea, labrynthine fistula.\n\tCholesteatoma in children is considered to be more aggressive than in the adult population.  Extensive disease is found more frequently in children compared to adults. Also, higher rates of residual and recurrent disease have been documented in the pediatric population.  However, the incidence of complications is directly related to the duration of disease, which is longer in adult patients.  Therefore, complication rates are higher in adults. \n Clinical Manifestations:  Most cholesteatomas are asymptomatic in their early development; children may come to medical attention with otorrhea and rarely complain of decreased hearing.  The most common presenting symptoms are hearing loss, otorrhea, otalgia, nasal obstruction, tinnitus and vertigo.  A previous history of middle ear disease, such as chronic otitis media and/or tympanic membrane perforation may be evident.

Both the PCL and ACL are intraarticular but extrasynovial\n\nThe PCL is a central stabilizer of the knee.  It is composed of an anterolateral band and posteromedial band that tighten on flexion & extension respectively and restrict posterior tibial displacement on the femur.  PCL is twice as strong as the ACL with a higher tensile strength and a larger cross sectional area.  Therefore, the ACL is more commonly injured than the PCL.  Injuries to PCL account for 5 – 20 % of knee ligament injuries and are usually associated with ACL, meniscus or collateral ligament damage. The most common location for PCL tear is the midportion representing 76% of all PCL injuries.  Avulsion from the femur (36 – 55%) and from the tibia ( 22 – 42%) are the other two locations of PCL tear. The mechanism of injury is excessive rotation, hyperextension, dislocation or direct trauma while the knee is flexed.  The most common causes of PCL injury are dashboard strikes in MVAs and contact sports. Clinically, the posterior drawer sign will be positive in 60% of PCL injuries. \n\nTreatment for PCL tears include surgical repair and non-operative treatment.

Additionally, any immunocompromised patient may be affected; organ recipients on immunosuppressive treatment, oncologic and hematologic patients, the elderly, severely malnourished children, and patients requiring prolonged corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe most common radiographic finding in patients with PCP consists of diffuse, bilateral symmetric ground-glass reticulonodular, or finely granular opacities occurring in a perihilar, or lower lung zone distribution.  Less commonly, PCP will occur with upper lobe predominance.  If untreated, these opacities may manifest as diffuse air space consolidation. As the disease progresses, interstitial disease will become more pronounced, and air cysts may be noticed in 5% to 35% of patients.  Occasionally, single or multiple nodules, miliary nodules, cavitation, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, and pleural effusion will be identified.  CT typically demonstrates symmetric bilateral ground-glass opacities, which may be diffuse, or have a mosaic pattern with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung giving a “crazy-paving” pattern. Spontaneous pneumothorax may be identified in 5% to 10% of patients, and is more common when cysts are present.   Pneumomediastinum may also be evident occurring by itself or in concert with pneumothorax.\n\nMost patients have characteristic radiographic findings of PCP, eliminating the need for CT.  However, in patients with symptoms and atypical radiographic findings, CT may show ground-glass opacities, that when correlated with the CD4+ count and other clinical markers may allow the correct diagnosis of PCP to be made.  Other causes of ground-glass opacities in patients with AIDS include CMV pneumonia and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.\n\nClinically, patients with PCP demonstrate nonspecific complaints.  Fever, cough, progressive dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, night sweats, and chest pain are all common symptoms.  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are frequently elevated, and patients demonstrate restrictive patterns on pulmonary function tests, with hypoxemia when exercising.  Clinicians may employ induced sputums, or use bronchoscopy with BAL to clinch the diagnosis.  BAL which has close to 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity in diagnosing PCP, is useful when positive, however when results are negative, transbronchial or open lung biopsy may be pursued when the clinical findings suggest a high probability of PCP.

The symptoms worsen with exertion.  Cranial muscles are affected in 85% cases (lids, extraocular muscles, facial weakness, nasal or slurred speech, dysphagia).  These may be the only muscles affected, especially in the elderly.  As the disease becomes generalized, the limb muscles (often proximal and asymmetric) become involved.  Reflexes and sensation should be normal.  Primary complications are aspiration pneumonia (weak bulbar muscles) and respiratory failure (weak chest wall muscles).Pathophysiology:Specific anti-AchR antibodies reduce the number of AchRs at the NMJ.  With repeated muscle contraction, there is a decrease in the amount of acetylcholine released per impulse.  This results in pathologic fatigue.  The thymus is abnormal in 75% of patients with myasthenia (65% hyperplasia and 10% thymomas).  The reason for this compelling association remains unknown, but it is theorized that because the thymus contains a small number of myoid cells (which are distinguished by muscle striations and AcH receptors on their surface) along with the B-cells and T-cells, the thymus may play a role in myasthenia gravis by acting as an antigenic peptide sequence on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Evaluation:\nOther autoimmune disorders may also be associated with myasthenia gravis (thyroiditis, Graves’ Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and pure red cell aplasia) and should be evaluated for in the newly diagnosed patient with myasthenia.\n\nEvaluation:\n1.\tAchR antibodies – positive antibodies are diagnostic but not correlated with disease severity\n2.\tTensilon (edrophonium) test – short-acting anticholinesterase\n3.\tEMG – low frequency (2-4Hz) repetitive stimulation produces decreased amplitude\n4.\tChest CT/MRI – search for thymic abnormalities\n5.\tOther associated autoimmune disorders\n\nMedical Management:\n1.\tOcular only – pyridostigmine\n2.\tGeneralized – pyridostigmine, and immunosuppression (while steroids are the mainstay of treatment, the addition of cyclosporin may allow a decrease in the steroid dose)\n3.\tCrisis – Intensive care (intubate, fluids), plasmapheresis or IVIg\n\nSurgical Management:\n1.\tEvaluate for thymectomy (improves the likelihood of long-term remission in the adult).\n\nThe efficacy and use of thymectomy in the absence of thymoma is still controversial.  A review of literature shows that thymectomy was associated with disease remission and improvement with a rate of medication free remission of 2.1 and an improvement rate of 1.7.  However, there are other studies that reveal no statistical difference between thymectomy in the absence of thymoma and medical management only.  Still, for several reasons most neurologists and CT surgeons still recommend that total thymectomy be done.  First, you cannot tell the difference between thymic hyperplasia and thymic atrophy on imaging studies.  A residual thymus as in this case, may represent thymic hyperplasia with potential to become a thymoma or be simple residual tissue.   Also, if a thymoma is present there is always a chance of malignancy.  Lastly, because it is theorized that the thymus acts as an APC for auto-antibodies, it is widely believed that a total thymectomy will improve the likelihood of long-term remission.", "keywords": "myasthenia gravisthymoma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1735_synpic16735", "MPX1735_synpic16737", "MPX1735_synpic16738", "MPX1735_synpic16739"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1735_synpic16735", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1735_synpic16735.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Residual Thymus", "age": "22", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "673.3155", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1735_synpic16737", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1735_synpic16737.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Residual Thymus", "age": "22", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "673.3155", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1735_synpic16738", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1735_synpic16738.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Residual Thymus", "age": "22", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "673.3155", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1735_synpic16739", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1735_synpic16739.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Residual Thymus", "age": "22", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "673.3155", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\nThis is a 22 y/o AD WF at NNMC where she has been followed by Neurology for one year for myasthenia gravis, treated with prednisone and cyclosporin.

First described in 1929 by Kling, Holmgren demonstrated the “fat-fluid” level radiographically in 1939 [1,2].  In 1942, Pierce et al. described a fat-fluid level, which had a fluid-fluid component and suggested that this phenomenon was the result of separation of blood into serum and cellular elements [2].  In 1996, Lugo-Olivieri et al. performed a retrospective review of 41 patients with tibial plateau fractures and found that joint effusions with fluid levels resulted from blood separating into cellular elements and supernatant serum, confirmed with CT or MR imaging. Lugo-Olivieri concluded that a single fluid-fluid level on radiographs in a post-traumatic knee did not necessarily reflect lipohemarthrosis, as hemarthrosis could appear similarly.  They suggested that a double fluid-fluid level is a more specific finding for intraarticular fat and an underlying fracture.\n\nLipohemarthrosis is more common in fractures about the knee, but has been described in the shoulder, elbow, and hip fractures [1].  CT and MRI are more specific than radiography in evaluating the composition of the effusion, but sonography may also have a role [1].  The anterior layer on ultrasound will appear hyperechogenic because of the fat. On CT, this area will be fat-density, and will follow fat signal on all MR pulse sequences [1,2].  The supernatant layer will be anechoic on US, fluid density on CT, and follow simple fluid signal on all MR sequences [1,2].

Common sites of occurrence include the femoral neck and calcaneus. They can also occur in the flat bones, the pelvis, and other locations. \nHistopathologically, intraosseous lipomas are categorized into three types: stage 1, solid tumor composed of viable lipocytes; stage 2, transitional cases with partial fat necrosis and focal calcification intermixed with regions of viable lipocytes; and stage 3, advanced cases in which fat cells have died with variable degree of cyst formation, calcification, and reactive new bone formation. The progression from stage 1 to stage 3 is caused by ischemia and infarction within the lesion and is thought to be related to the rigid structure of bone opposing the lesion’s fat cell expansion and multiplication. These lesions may also cause resorption and expansion of bone, whereas bone infarcts do not cause expansion of the bone.\n  The radiographic features of intraosseous lipomas are based upon the histologic stage of the lesion. The stage 1 lesions are lucent and represent viable fat with resorption of bony trabeculae. Stage 2 lesions have lucent areas, which consist of viable fat and radiodense areas that consist of fat necrosis and dystrophic calcification. Stage 2 lesions can be expansile. Stage 3 lesions reflect resorption of normal bone, but they are more radiodense than stage 1 or 2 lesions. The radiodensity is a result of calcification and extensive fat necrosis. Stage 3 lesions also have thick sclerotic borders, presumably related to involution of these lesions. Radiologically, the differential diagnosis of intraosseous lipomas includes fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cysts, simple bone cysts, bone infarcts, chondroid tumors, and liposclerosing myxofibrous tumors. \n  On CT, stage 1 intraosseous lipomas exhibit resorption of bone trabeculae in the lesion and bone expansion. The area of lucency seen on the radiograph corresponds to fat attenuation visible on CT. Stage 2 lesions have areas of fat attenuation and patchy areas of increased density corresponding to calcification and fat necrosis. Stage 3 intraosseous lipomas are the most difficult to diagnose because of the reactive ossification, calcification, fat necrosis, and cyst formation caused by necrosis of the fat component. If the lesion has a peripheral rim of discernible fat, it will help to eliminate other conditions generally considered in the differential diagnosis. Lesions that exhibit resorption of trabecular bone and predominantly central calcification instead of peripheral calcification are more likely to be stage 3 intraosseous lipomas than bone infarcts; the latter are non-expansile lesions that have a peripheral serpentine thin rim of sclerosis and are not associated with trabecular resorption. \n  MR imaging reveals viable fat in stage 1 intraosseous lipomas. The fat is isointense to subcutaneous fat on T1-weighted sequences and exhibits low signal intensity with fat suppression on T2-weighted images. A thin circumferential rim of low signal intensity on T1- and T2- weighted sequences is typically present demarcating the margin of the fatty lesion consistent with reactive sclerosis surrounding the lesion. In stage 2 lesions, one can again identify fat and the circumferential rim of decreased signal on T1- and T2-weighted images. Low-signal-intensity areas within the central portion of the lesion on T1- and T2-weighted images are consistent with calcifications.  Stage 3 lesions show a thin peripheral rim of fat, which can be identified on MR imaging. They also have central calcification and a thick rim of surrounding sclerosis, which have low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences.

HA are typically solitary in nature, but ~20% are multiple.  They typically do not have bile ducts or portal vein areas.  They are typically rows of heapatocytes.  HA can develop central necrosis and hemorrhage because the vascular supply is often restricted to the outer surface of the tumor.  Typically in young woman using oral contraceptives pills (OCP) HA is one of the more common hepatic neoplasm as in this patient.  Also, individuals with hemochromatosis , glycogen storage disease, acromegaly, and anabolic steroids users with a hepatic mass are likely to be HA as well.  Some believe that the OCP & anabolic steroids lead to generalized vascular ectasia of the liver leading to the development of HA.  80% of adenomas are solitary and 20% are multiple.\n\nComputed Tomography (CT) in triple phase liver dedicated study demonstrate most HA as a lesion with homogeneous enhancement in the late arterial phase, that will stay isodense to the liver in later phases.  However, these findings in the late arterial phase are not specific to adenomas, since hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hemangiomas, hypervascular metastases, & focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) can show similar enhancement in the arterial phase.  The finding of hemorrhage as an area of high attenuation can be seen in as many as 40% of adenomas.  Fat deposition within adenomas is often difficult to identify on CT and is better visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nDue to the risk of intraperitoneal hemorrhage of the HA & the rare occurrence of malignant transformation to HCC, surgical resection has been advocated as the best solution for patients with presumed HA as was done in this case.  Percutaneous fine needle biopsy of a mass suspicious for HA is controversial because of a significant risk hemorrhage & difficult to distinguish from FNH histologically (FNH does not require surgical resection), however, was still performed in this case, but diagnosis could not be made from biopsy.    Also, HA may also decrease in size if not disappear after OCPs have been stopped, in this pt the lesion was felt to be too large to pursue this treatment.  \n\nReference:\nRichard Baron. “Liver : Masses Part II : common liver tumors”.

Close inspection demonstrates the small size of the superior aspect or final turn of the cochlea.  Only the internal architecture is different.  Inspection of the semicircular canals is important since the can also be abnormally dilated (as in this case).", "topic_title": "Mondini Deformity.", "acr_code": "1.1", "category": "Congenital, malformation", "disease_discussion": "In the original scientific report written in Latin by Carlo Mondini in 1791, titled The Anatomic Section of a Boy Born Deaf, translated to English by Gordon J. Hartley in the American Journal of Otology, the inner ear anomaly described by Mondini consisted of:\n\n1) a cochlea of one-and-one-half turns instead of the normal two-and-one-half turns, comprising a normal basal turn and a cystic apex in place of the distal one-and-one-half turns; \n2) an enlarged vestibule with normal semicircular canals; and \n3) an enlarged vestibular aqueduct containing a dilated endolymphatic sac.  \n\nThus, the cochlear anomaly was relatively mild, and would correspond to incomplete partition in the spectrum of congenital cochlear malformation because of an arrest of embryogenesis.  Arrests at earlier stages in the spectrum include cochlear hypoplasia and common cavity and cochlear aplasia. Even earlier arrests result in otocyst and complete labyrinthine aplasia (Michel's anomaly).\n\nThe most common of the congenital cochlear deformities is Mondini's defect, which occurs late in auditory embryologic development, usually at 7 to 8 weeks.  The scala separations of the lumen of the cochlea are not developed completely at this point.  Essentially, Mondini's defect is incomplete development of the two-and-a-half turns of the cochlea.  The basal turn is relatively well formed, but the middle and apical turns are malformed.  Variations in the number of remaining turns in the cochlea comprise various types of otic dysplasia.  Enlargement of the vestibule is not an uncommon finding with cochlear abnormalities.  Enlargement of the endolymphatic sac in association with a large vestibular aqueduct is present in about 20% of Mondini malformations. \n\nRadiologically, the anomaly was recognized on polytomography by Jensen as early as 1969. Subsequently, he also described a more severe type of deformity consisting of an amorphous cochlear sac continuous with a dilated vestibule, for which he suggested the term \"dysplasia\". Unfortunately, the term \"Mondini dysplasia\" has come to mean virtually any congenital malformation of the osseous labyrinth detectable on radiographic examination.\n\nA recent retrospective review of temporal bone high-resolution CT findings was performed because it was realized that the term Mondini deformity was being used to describe two different types of incomplete partition of the cochlea. By taking inner ear measurements on radiologic findings they confirmed the presence of two different types of incomplete partition: IP-I (unpartitioned cochlea, cystic cochleovestibular malformation) and IP-II (incompletely partitioned cochlea, the classic Mondini deformity).\n\nIncomplete partition type I (unpartitioned cochlea, cystic cochleovestibular malformation) is defined as a malformation in which the cochlea lacks the entire modiolus and interscalar septa, resulting in a cystic appearance and there is an accompanying grossly dilated vestibule. Cochlear measurements show no significant difference from normal.\n\nThe type I malformation is less differentiated than the type II malformation.  Classic Mondini deformity has three components (a cystic apex, dilated vestibule, and large vestibular aqueduct), whereas type I malformation has an empty, unpartitioned cochlea and dilated vestibule without an enlarged vestibular aqueduct.  Classic Mondini deformity represents a later malformation, so the degree of dysplasia is milder than that in type I.", "keywords": "Mondinicochleavestibular", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2558_synpic20826", "MPX2558_synpic20827", "MPX2558_synpic20828", "MPX2558_synpic20829", "MPX2558_synpic20830", "MPX2558_synpic20831", "MPX2558_synpic20832"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2558_synpic20826", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2558_synpic20826.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "View of left cochlea.

It has taken some time for vendors to develop the software necessary to accurately and efficiently use existing MR technology for a screening population.  MR utility has been extensively used for problem-solving and for evaluation of the patient with impants. \n\nThe exquisite contrast sensitivity of MR is balanced in the high-risk patient by somewhat decreased specificity; many things other than cancer enhance, but benign entities often have an intrinsic high T2 signal whereas breast cancer does not.\n\nSensitivity has been greatly improved with the use of dynamic contrast-enhancement, and the addition of software tools allowing the creation of a graphical depiction of contrast kinetics within a specified region of interest.  Given that the region is selected appropriately, breast cancer tissue will typically exhibit an early wash-in, and a rapid wash-out of contrast enhancement.  In contradistinction, beningn tissue will demonstrate a progressive increase in enhancement or alternatively a plateau. \n\nSoftware refinements continue to be made in order to hopefully better define the specific region of interest and therefore yield the best curve.\n\nAt the time this case was performed, the combination fo software and hardware technology necessary to perform adequate screening MR had only been available for approximately 2 months.  This patient's cancer was only detectable initially through this modality.  The mammogram was, even retrospectively, negative, and there was no palpable abnormality for which to justify an ultrasound (although the lesion was in fact visible under ultrasound).  This cancer almost certainly would have not been found until it was at a much more advanced state, and this patient's life may have just been saved-- a feat that would have likely not been possible just a few months ago.", "topic_title": "Infiltrating ductal carcinoma", "acr_code": "0.3", "category": "Neoplasm, carcinoma", "disease_discussion": "The majority of invasive breast cancers are nonspecific forms of carcinoma that orginate in the ductal epithelium, likely in the terminal duct at its juncton with the lobule.  The better differentiated forms of invasive ductal carcinoma create specfic patterns that have been subclassified but the majority of ductal malignancies fall into the general category of undifferentiated cancers.  When a cancer does not fit into any of the defined subtypes it is termed not otherwise specified (NOS).  The relative frequency of these lesion appears to remain fairly constant regardless of age.  In general, infiltrating ductal carcinoma NOS elicits a vigorous desmosplastic response with fibrosis. \n\nSometimes, these cancers are found first by the woman herself.  In general, these are firm lesions that may tether to the skin or the chest wall.  Vascular and lymphatic spread result, and if left untreated, carcinoma may eventually erode through the skin, producing an ulcerated mass.  Dermal lymphatic involvement with tumor can occur early in the course early in the course of the disease, signaling the poor prognosis associated with inflammatory carcinoma.  \n\nPathologist have subclassified infiltrating ductal carcinoma into low-grade (I) fairly uniform cell types that show some differentiation (mucin or tubule) to high grade (III) in which anaplastic, pleomorphic cell predominate.  Collagen production is prominent feature of many breast cancers, and calcium deposition is common within the tumor.  These are responsible for the characteristic firm gritty nature of these malignancies.\n\nThe mammographic appearance of breast cancer is varied.  The diagnosis is high suggestive when an irregular mass with spiculated margins is present.  Lobulated shapes are fairly common, and the more undulating the border, the more suspicious the lesion.  Some ductal cancers reveal their presence early by the deposition of calcium which is due to either direct cellular secretion or cell necrosis.  The fibrosis, desmoplasia and cicatrization that accompany many ductal cancers may produce distortion of surrounding architecture with or without an apparent tumor mass, and this may lead to skin/nipple retraction.  Breast cancer usually produces an ill-defined shadow, but even “garden variety” infiltrating ductal carcinoma may produce a sharply circumscribed mass that is indistinguishable from a benign lesion.  The generally greater x-ray attenutation relative to its volume often distinguishes the malignant lesion.\n\nSome cancers infiltrate without distorting the normal breast architecture and without calcium deposition.  If the normal parenchymal abutting the tumor is the same radiographic density, the tumor may be undectable by mammography.  Occasionally, the only indication of the presence of cancer nonspecific asymmetric density.\n\nJust as there is spectrum of mammographic presentations, the ultrasound appearance of breast cancer is extremely variable.  The classic description of breast cancer is an irregularly shaped hypoechoic structure that frequently has a triangular anterior margin and attenuates and scatters sound, producing shadowing.  This appearance is characteristic of a spiculated scirrhous lesion.  Cancers are almost always irregular, frequently lobulated and hypoechoic.  Breast cancers tend to be more vertically oriented relative to the skin surface but there are always exceptions.

Brain growth is inhibited by prolonged uncorrected restriction of cranial growth. Compression of underlying brain is more likely when multiple sutures are affected. \n\nThe mechanism of synostosis is unknown.  One mechanism proposes an intrinsic abnormality in the cranial base that causes early fusion. This theory is supported by laboratory studies of osteoblasts from craniosynostotic sutures.  Craniosynostosis also has been associated with endocrine abnormalities, such as hyperthyroidism, and use of warfarin during pregnancy.\n\nThe diagnosis of craniofacial deformities is based primarily upon physical examination. Historically, pattern recognition has been the basis for clinical diagnosis. Radiographic studies including plain radiographs and CT may be used to help confirm or exclude the diagnosis of craniosynostosis.\n\nScaphocephaly is treated by a strip craniectomy performed at three or four months of age.

Thirty percent contain calcifications.  They vary from an almost entirely cystic mass to a predominately solid mass with internal cystic components.\n\nBenign (mature) cystic teratomas, often incorrectly termed \"dermoid cysts\", are usually found in female patients 10-30 years old - very common in the reproductive years.  Teratoma is the most common ovarian tumor in children, adolescents, and young women (<30 years) with the majority presenting in adolescents.  Fifteen to 25% of cases are bilateral.  Most authors differentiate Dermoid cysts from Dermoids which are predominately cystic, but the presence of heterogeneous and varied tissue elements give them a complex and varied imaging appearance. \n\nTrue dermoids - unlike mature cystic teratomas - originate from ectoderm only and may contain hair, teeth, and sebaceous glands, whereas teratomas originate from multipotential germ cells that may and may contain any tissue element: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm .\n\nTeratomas may also be found in the mediastinum, intracranially, or anywhere rests of multipotential germ cells were left during embryogenesis.  In fact, teratomas are the most common congenital intracranial tumor.  Additionally, teratomas are the most common benign mediastinal germ cell neoplasm and may be cystic or solid.  The cystic teratomas are usually more mature and more common than the solid type which is usually malignant.  \n\nBenign teratomas have a slight female predominance; and, malignant teratomas are seen almost exclusively in men.  Malignant abdominopelvic teratomas may be accompanied by ascites, intraperitoneal spread, and metastasis to the liver.  \n\nMalignant degeneration of a mature cystic teratoma is rare - but may occurs in 1-2% of cases.  \n\nCommon complications of ovarian teratomas include torsion (ovarian) and hemorrhage.\n\nThe initial imaging modality is usually a sonographic study, as many patients present with abdominal pain.  The mixture of sebum and hair within a mature teratoma is highly echogenic with acoustic shadowing that may totally obscure the back wall of a large mass, a finding known as the “tip of the iceberg” sign.   However, calcification may not be easily detected on ultrasound and plain radiographs may be diagnostic of benign cystic teratomas by demonstrating well formed teeth or bone.  A recognizable tooth within the mass is an almost pathognomonic finding.  Plain film may also reveal a subtle well-defined mass of fat density.  \n\nCT scan confirms the cystic, fatty, and calcified components and demonstrates a well circumscribed cystic mass lesion with fluid, fat, and calcification.  \n\nCharacterization by MRI depends on demonstration of fat by chemical shift artifact or fat suppression imaging.

Fat-fluid levels, layering of debris, dermoid plugs (mural nodules), and calcifications are additional findings.

It is classified as a prion disease, which is an abnormal conformation of a host glycoprotein, that replicates in a self-perpetuating cycle of abnormal proteins and amyloid plaques. CJD has a long incubation period, with most cases presenting in the sixth or seventh decade of life. CJD has a mean onset of 62 years, with reports of cases ranging from 17 to 83 years of age. The incidence is approximately 1 case per million internationally and in the United States, with some Libyan Jewish populations and a few populations in rural areas of Slovakia, having 60-100 times this rate of familial CJD. \n\nThere are three classifications of CJD: sporadic (spontaneous mutation), variant (infectious), and familial. Familial CJD accounts for about 10% of all cases, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  The mean duration after symptoms present is 8 months for the sporadic form, 16 months for variant, and 26 months for familial form. \n\nCJD is characterized by a rapidly progressive cognitive imparement, behavorial abnormalities, myoclonic jerks, higher cortical dysfunction and visual cortical abnormalities, cerebellar dysfunction, and pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. These signs and symptoms steadily increase, with death primarily occurring secondary to bronchopneumonia, due to overall disability and a bed-ridden state.\n\nTesting for CJD is difficult at best, and in its early stages can present like many different disease processes, with a definitive diagnosis being accomplished only after a biopsy of brain tissue. Sixty percent of patients show characteristic EEG changes of periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) on a slow and low-voltage background.  However, EEG has a low specificity and a sensitivity of only 50.0%. Testing for brain specific proteins such as the 14-3-3 protein and the neuron-specific enolase also supports a diagnoses of CJD, but even though they are more specific than EEG, they have a sensitivity of 84.0% and\n73.3% respectfully.\n\nPET scanning may show regional hypometabolism of glucose.\n\nThe most sensitive test to date is the MRI diffusion weighted images (DWI), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 92.3% and 93.8 respectfully.

Although this patient had no known history of hypertension, her CT and MRI both demonstrate evidence of chronic small vessel ischemia secondary to longstanding hypertension.  The differential diagnosis for a hemorrhagic lesion in the putamen/posterior capsule includes lacunar infarct, hypertensive hemorrhage, vascular malformation, and neoplasm.\n\nLacunar infarcts represent 15-20% of all strokes, and appear as small cavitary lesions in subcortical regions.  They result from the thrombosis of a small penetrating artery, often as a result of a chronic hypertensive change known as lipohyalinosis.  Characteristic locations for lacunar infarcts include the following:  putamen (37%), pons (16%), thalamus (14%), caudate (10%), and internal capsule (10%).  Posterior limb lacunes are the most important clinically because of their potential for severe motor and sensory deficits.  Anterior limb lacunes are often clincally silent.\nThese \"perforating\" arteries (lenticulostriate aa., thalamogeniculate aa., and anterior choroidal branch of ICA) are common sites for both lacunar infarcts and hypertensive hemorrhage, and both types of lesions can result from a process known as lipohyalinosis.  This is the impregnation of hyaline-lipid material into the walls of small arteries in the setting of hypertension combined with atherosclerosis.  Lipohyalinosis predisposes the artery to thrombosis and may also weaken the vessel wall, resulting in small dissecting \"Charcot-Bouchard\" aneurysms.\n\nHypertensive hemorrhages are slightly less common than lacunar infarcts, representing 10-15% of all strokes.  Two-thirds of hypertensive hemorrhages occur in the putamen, but most cases occur in the presence of systolic blood pressures much higher than 170.

There was no urolithiasis or hydronephrosis, but there was interval development of significant perinephric stranding. Given lack of other clinical findings of pyelonephritis, a renal mass could not be excluded, and a contrast examination was ordered.\n\nContrast CT demonstrated a wedge shaped area of non-perfusion in the upper outer aspect of the left kidney. A renal infarct was felt to be the most likely etiology, though there was no history to suggest a source. Further evaluation included echocardiography, which was negative. Laboratory analysis for abnormal clotting factors was negative. As fibromuscular dysplasia and vasculitis were also considered, renal MRA performed. This again demonstrated the area of non-perfusion in the left kidney, but also showed irregular narrowing and dilation of both renal arteries, highly suggest of fibromuscular dysplasia.\n\nThe patient was treated for symptoms and placed on Plavix.

The detection of a cystic lesion with an even thick capsule containing peripheral or lumenal soft tissue nodules or septations is less consistent with a pseudocyst and more indicative of a neoplastic process with associated necrosis. When the attenuation values of the pseudocyst are slightly elevated, associated necrotic tissue or secondary infection should be suspected. Higher attenuation values of >40 to 50 HU are indicative of intracystic hemorrhage.", "topic_title": "Pancreatic Pseudocyst", "acr_code": "7.2", "category": "Inflammatory, NOS", "disease_discussion": "Pancreatic pseudocysts are non-epithelial lined cystic fluid collections that arise from disruption of a pancreatic duct, with leakage of amylase-rich pancreatic juice into the surrounding peripancreatic tissues. Pancreatic pseudocysts are one of four cystic lesions of the pancreas but accounts for 75% of all pancreatic cysts. The other three lesions include 1) benign and malignant cystic neoplasms (10%), 2) congenital cysts (5%), and 3) retention cysts (10%). Although pancreatic pseudocysts are the most common cystic lesion, neoplastic cysts must always be considered, particularly when contemplating nonsurgical treatment of a pancreatic cyst, since no diagnostic test or method is definitive or sensitive enough to distinguish the two.\n\n-Etiology and Pathogenesis: \nPseudocysts form after rupture of a pancreatic duct with extravasation of amylase-rich fluid and failure of reabsorption of this secretion. The extravasated fluid forms an encapsulated collection that is bound by surrounding viscera, that is, the stomach, spleen, liver, and transverse mesocolon. The fluid collections initially communicate with the ruptured pancreatic duct. Endoscopic studies have shown that pancreatic pseudocysts communicate with the pancreatic duct in 80% of cases. Pseudocysts are preceded by pancreatitis in 90% of cases and by trauma in 10%. Approximately 85% are located in the body or tail of the pancreas and 15% in the head. Some patients have two or more pseudocysts. Abdominal pain, with or without radiation to the back, is the usual presenting complaint. A palpable, tender mass may be found in the middle or left upper abdomen. The serum amylase level is elevated in 75% of patients at some point during their illness and may fluctuate markedly\n\n-Epidemiology: \nAxial imaging in acute pancreatitis has demonstrated peripancreatic fluid collections in as many as 80% of studies. Pseudocysts occur less frequently than do acute fluid collections and require more time to form with prevalence ranging from 5% to 70% depending on the severity of the attack and the depth of investigation. There is no gender preference. \n\n-Clinical Manifestations:  \nPseudocysts usually require at least 4 or more weeks to evolve, following an episode of acute pancreatitis. However, the natural history and clinical relevance of pancreatic pseudocysts have been challenging due to lack of unified methods of dectection. Cysts have indeterminate age and most are stable on follow-up examinations. Symptomatic cysts may manifest as persistent abdominal pain with or without radiating to back, abdominal mass, gastric outlet obstruction, and biliary obstruction. Infection is suspected in septic patients and, unless air bubbles produced gas-forming bacteria are present, the diagnosis should be confirmed with FNA. A pseudocyst that does not resolve spontaneously may lead to serious complications, such as (1) pain caused by expansion of the lesion and pressure on other viscera, (2) rupture, (3) hemorrhage, and (4) abscess. Rupture of a pancreatic pseudocyst is a particularly serious complication. Shock almost always supervenes. Mortality rates range from 14%, if the rupture is not associated with hemorrhage, to over 60% if hemorrhage has occurred. Rupture and hemorrhage are the prime causes of death from pancreatic pseudocyst. A triad of findings: (1) increase in the size of the mass, (2) a localized bruit over the mass, and (3) a sudden decrease in hemoglobin level and hematocrit without obvious external blood loss, should alert one to the possibility of hemorrhage from a pseudocyst.\n\n-Treatment:   \nIn studies with sonography, pseudocysts were seen to resolve in 25 to 40% of patients. Pseudocysts that are greater than 5 cm in diameter and that persist for longer than 6 weeks should be considered for drainage.

Some sources state that they account for as little as 0.3% to as much as 1.8% of tumors.  During the third and fifth week of fetal development during the closure of the neural tube, epidermoids derive from the ectopic inclusions of epithelial cells.  If the cells have less cell differentiation, they result in dermoid tumors instead of epidermoid tumors.  The epithelial lesions grow at a rate similar to skin cells, and as a result, cause a very slow symptomatic onset.  \n\nThey usually arise in the suprasellar region, the skull base, brainstem, or cerebellopontine angle.  Recent literature suggests that epidermoid tumors have mostly been found at the cerebellopontine angle (37.3%) and in the parasellar region (30%), growing by spreading in the subarachnoid space of the basal cisterns.  They rarely develop into malignant processes.\n\nEpidermoids have a pearly appearance and are well circumscribed and encapsulated.  The epidermoids that are hypodense on CT may contain a soft, waxy material that consists of cholesterol crystals.  The hyperintense epidermoids on the other hand are mostly cystic and contain fluid of various colors.  Other sources suggest that the inner material is due to the progressive desquamation and breakdown of keratin.\n\nSymptoms associated with epidermoids usually appear after the second decade of life.  These symptoms are caused by displacement of adjacent vascular and neural structures.  The most frequent presenting symptom is trigeminal neuralgia.  Other symptoms that can occur are similar to those caused by acoustic neuroma like vertigo, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral tinnitus.  If the lesion gets very large, symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, and ataxia, or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus can develop.      \n\nOn imaging, most epidermoid tumors show a distinctive MRI appearance.  They are usually hypointense on T1 MRI and hyperintense on T2 MRI.  On T1, they can also show a characteristically marbled inner pattern.  Diffussion-weighted imaging can provide additional information by showing a clear, hyperintense signal.  On CT, an epidermoid can appear as a well-defined lobulated hypodense mass.\n\nTreatment is surgical resection with radical removal of the tumor capsule.", "keywords": "EpidermoidCerebellopontineMRI", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1796_synpic42084", "MPX1796_synpic42085", "MPX1796_synpic42086", "MPX1796_synpic42087", "MPX1796_synpic42088"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1796_synpic42084", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1796_synpic42084.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Slightly hyperintense mass with irregular contour at the left cerebellopontine angle.", "age": "78", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.3", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX1796_synpic42085", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1796_synpic42085.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W w/Gadolinium", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "There is a hypointense mass with irregular borders in the left cerebellopontine angle.

Pathologically enlarged ovaries from cysts, tumors or paraovarian cysts are at risk for torsion.  The most common ovarian neoplasm involved is the benign cystic teratoma. Ovarian torsion may also occur in a normal ovary with a hypermobile adnexa, which may be seen in prepubertal girls and pregnancy, or an excessively long mesosalpinx. Ovarian torsion usually affects young women and more commonly prepubertal girls.  There is also an increased risk during pregnancy. \n\nThe patient presentation may be nonspecific and therefore the patients may undergo extensive evaluation before establishing a diagnosis. Patients typically present with sudden onset or gradual severe lower abdominal or pelvic pain with or without nausea, vomiting and fever. Approximately half of patients with ovarian torsion will have a palpable mass. Initially the torsed ovary undergoes venous stasis and if prolonged, congestion and edema progress with arterial stasis resulting in hemorrhagic necrosis and gangrene. Torsion involves the right ovary more than the left and this is thought due to a potential protective effect of the sigmoid mesentery. \n\nRadiologic evaluation of patients with ovarian torsion is optimally performed with ultrasound but often these patients undergo other imaging modalities due to their nonspecific presentation. Ultrasound findings include a markedly enlarged hypo or hyperechoic midline mass with multiple peripheral cysts/follicles measuring 8-12 mm in diameter. There is often good sound transmission due to edema from vascular engorgement. Cul-de-sac free pelvic fluid may be seen in approximately one third. Absence of ovarian arterial and venous Doppler waveforms is helpful to establish the diagnosis but not always reliable due to the dual blood supply by the uterine and ovarian arteries. Also helpful but not always visible is the “whirlpool” sign from the twisted ovarian pedicle. A complex mass may be identified if there is a cyst or tumor as a lead point.  \n\nComputed tomography may be performed as the initial imaging modality. Findings of ovarian torsion on CT include a large adenxal or ovarian mass with smooth wall thickening and no enhancing solid component. Peripherally located follicles may or may not be visible. Other associated findings include thickening of the involved fallopian tube or visualizing the torsed vascular pedicle as a whorled structure adjacent to the ovarian mass.

{"uid": "MPX1363", "title": "Alzheimer disease", "history": "An 84-year-old man presents with a 3-year history of progressive memory loss, dementia, and difficulty communicating as noted by his family.  An MRI was performed.", "exam": "", "findings": "", "differential_diagnosis": "", "diagnosis": "Alzheimer disease", "diagnosis_by": "Brain biopsy", "treatment": "", "discussion": "", "topic_title": "Alzheimer disease", "acr_code": "1.9", "category": "Degenerative Disease", "disease_discussion": "1) An MRI of this patient revealed generalized cerebral atrophy with narrowed gyri and widened sulci, suggesting a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) (Figure 1).  AD, the most common cause of dementia, is a frequent occurrence among the elderly population.  Approximately 4.9 million people over the age of 65 are living with the diagnosis of AD.[1]  The disease provides a great burden to family members and has a wide impact on Medicare spending.  Although many advances have been made in providing clinical, radiographic, and biomarker evidence for AD diagnosis, the disease is only definitively diagnosed by brain biopsy or at autopsy.  \n\nGross pathologic exam of the AD patient at autopsy reveals diffuse cerebral atrophy (Figure 2), most prominently in the medial temporal lobes.  Histological exam reveals senile plaques composed of an amyloid β (Aβ) core (Figure 3).  Aβ is also seen deposited in cerebral vessel walls of AD patients.  Histological evaluation at autopsy additionally reveals neurofibrillary tangles (Figure 4) within the cerebral parenchyma, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.[2]\n\nAD is also associated with degeneration in the basal forebrain and a resulting loss of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  This loss of acetylcholine is closely related to memory deficits.[3]  As such, the major class of pharmacologic therapy for AD focuses on inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine.  While some relief from AD symptoms is seen with the use of this class of medication, the long-term progression of the disease does not appear to be altered.\n\nPatients with AD have been distinguished from age-matched controls by a significant bilateral reduction in blood flow or metabolism in the temporoparietal cortex using functional neuroimaging.[4]  Additionally, perfusion and diffusion-weighted MR imaging illustrate a bilateral reduction in perfusion in the sensorimotor regions in patients with AD.[4]  The radiographic evidence of hypoperfusion in these regions is consistent with the clinical presentation of AD, namely impairment of recent memory formation, language deficits, and difficulty executing previously learned motor processes.\n\nVarious radiographic measurement techniques have been attempted for relative certainty in early diagnosis of AD.   Bastos-Leite et al identified that hippocampal atrophy could be measured by T1-weighted MR imaging of hippocampal sulcus width.[5]  Furthermore, gross pathologic examination of patients with AD reveals significant bilateral atrophy of the cerebral parenchyma with widened sulci, most notably in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.\n\nAtrophy in the frontal and temporal lobe pars orbitalis is suggestive of Pick disease (PD).[6]  PD and AD may present clinically with similar features.  PD typically presents with personality changes and frontotemporal lobe atrophy, and is characterized by greater atrophy of the anterior brain than is seen in AD.[6]  A well-circumscribed lesion with a mass effect on noncontrast CT would indicate a hemorrhage or hematoma.  Multiple oval lesions seen on MRI are found in multiple sclerosis and are frequently found in the periventricular white matter.[7]  Structural changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta are characteristic of Parkinson disease.  Parkinson disease structural changes can be detected through MR imaging while positron emission tomography can be used to measure dopa uptake into the striatum.[8]\n\n2.  Central to the degeneration seen in AD is an accumulation of Aβ peptides, derived from amyloid β precursor protein (A?PP).[9]  These peptides have been found deposited throughout the extracellular space of AD plaques and have thus been used as an important pathological marker for AD.[9]  While a correlation between A? and AD has been identified, A? is not strictly localized to the central nervous system and is seen in many other organs including lung, liver, heart, and spleen.[9]  The accumulation of A? in cerebral parenchyma has been shown to be neurotoxic [10,11] and likely contributes to spectrum of clinical features observed in AD.\n\nLewy bodies are aggregates of α-synuclein most commonly found in Parkinson disease.  Astroglia are supportive cells of the central nervous system and an abundance of these cells would be associated with an astrocytoma.  Sphingolipid accumulation is seen in Niemann-Pick disease.  N-acetyl aspartate is used as a marker of neurons and a decrease is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.\n\n3.  Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a protein that is involved in the metabolism of cholesterol and is synthesized by astrocytes.  The gene is located on chromosome 19 and is thought to play a role in the repair of injured nerves.[12]  Of the four APOE alleles, the one with the closest association to AD is ε4.  Many studies have suggested a correlation between APOE ε4 and AD memory impairment, most significantly in older adults.[12]  APOE encodes a protein that, within the extracellular space, binds cholesterol and becomes incorporated into myelin and cell membranes.  As such, this protein is believed to be involved in the generation of neural synapses.[12]\n\nSynaptic degradation resulting from the mutated apoE ε4 allele and defective synaptogenesis may play a role in the atrophy of the corpus collosum in AD.[13]  The degeneration of the corpus collosum and cingulate gyrus in AD is reflected in the apparent deficits in intrahemispheric connection.[13]  The role of an APOE ε4 mutation has been associated with AD as a significant risk factor for developing sporadic AD as well as earlier age of onset of the disease.  Although these associations have been established, the role of APOE ε4 as a biomarker is still in question as not all patients with the ε4 allele develop AD.  Similarly, patients lacking the ε4 allele are not excluded from developing sporadic AD.[14]\n\nA mutation in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene is seen in Niemann-Pick disease.  The superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Kinesin family member 1B (KIF1B) mutations have been linked to the peripheral nerve disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.  β-Hexosaminidase A, α subunit (HEXA) mutations are seen in association with Tay-Sachs disease.\n\n4.  Patients suffering from AD exhibit pathological changes in the brain including a diffuse loss of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus.[15]  This neurological degradation leads to clinical memory loss and dementia.  The hippocampus functions in memory formation and a loss of neurons leads to difficulty forming new memories.  The loss of neurons in these regions correlates to the pathologic and neuroradiological findings of cerebral atrophy.  As noted above, cerebral atrophy is prominent in the brain of a patient with AD at autopsy, particularly in the medial temporal lobes.[5]  Loss of neurons in alternate brain regions, including hypothalamus, cerebellum, and mammillary bodies are not associated with AD pathology. \n\n5.  The major histological diagnostic findings at autopsy of a patient with AD are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Two cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, Aβ and tau, have been validated in association with AD and can be used to distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease.[16]  An elevation in neurotoxic Aβ leads to the deposition of Aβ plaques in the cerebral parenchyma (leading to the accumulation of senile plaques) as well as in the walls of cerebral blood vessels.[2]  The neurofibrillary tangle (Figure 3), another pathologic finding in AD, consists of an aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.[2]\n\nAmyloid precursor protein is normally cleaved by α-secretase to yield multiple fragments that are chiefly eliminated from the brain.  Abnormal cleavage results from a mutation in the amyloid precursor protein, resulting in cleavage by both β-secretase and γ-secretase, leading to aggregations of abnormally cleaved Aβ with other proteins such as tau, apoE, and presenilin 1 and 2.  These aggregates form the basis for senile plaques (Figure 3) in AD pathology.[17]\n\nAmyloid association with AD has been further established through the exploration of early AD development in adults with Down syndrome.  Down syndrome (trisomy 21) patients living into adulthood have been found to develop senile plaques with Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex at a significantly younger age than individuals without Down syndrome.  The findings of early development of plaques and tangles in association with a duplicate chromosome 21 lead to further linkage studies that proposed an association between the chromosome and AD pathology.  These studies found that mutations in a region of the 21st chromosome, near the gene encoding β-amyloid and duplicated in trisomy 21, have been associated with familial early-onset AD.[17]\n\nThe presence of biomarkers in the CSF other than amyloid β and tau have not been found in association with AD.

This results in negative sinus pressure and collapse over time.  This syndrome has primarily been described in the otolaryngology and ophthalmology literature. The patient is typically an adult who presents to an ophthalmologist or an ENT specialist with a chronic history of painless facial asymmetry (one eye lower and sunken), diplopia, or both.  The patient may have symptoms of sinusitis but may be asymptomatic. \n\nThe diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed radiologically. Physical exam reveals a combination of enophthalmos, hypoglobus, upper-lid retraction, deepened upper-lid sulcus, and malar depression.\n\nRadiologic evaluation is primarily by CT.  The imaging findings of the silent sinus syndrome a fully developed and opacified maxillary sinus with occluded infundibulum.  Occlusion is usually caused by lateral retraction of the uncinate process with apposition of the uncinate process against the inferomedial aspect of the orbital wall. There is resultant enlargement of the adjacent middle meatus with associated lateral retraction of the middle turbinate. The feature most characteristic is inward retraction of the sinus walls (medial wall, posterolateral wall, and orbital floor) with associated decrease in sinus volume. The downward retraction of the orbital floor into the maxillary sinus creates the eye or facial asymmetry.\n\nTreatment is surgical involving making an outlet for mucous drainage from the obstructed sinus. A nasal antral window or a maxillary antrostomy is performed endoscopically. The post surgical sinus deformity may remain unchanged, improve slightly, or be restored to a near-normal configuration over time. Additional corrective surgery of the orbital floor may be accomplished.\n\n============================\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=94203633\nhttp://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/figsonly/178/2/503\nhttp://www.laryngoscope.com/pt/re/laryngoscope/abstract.00005537-200106000-00008.htm;jsessionid=CFN5meDK83rOWfejtjGhVdI9eNOhOeY6WnvGHqPCy2fdePgnNvQU!583875742!-949856031!9001!-1\nhttp://www.laryngoscope.com/pt/re/laryngoscope/abstract.00020840-199902000-00009.htm;jsessionid=CFN58WbqxkzTMJuHWoh1quFdWgPKXuCwImn5HUmV2wdjisErBWqc!583875742!-949856031!9001!-1", "keywords": "silent sinus syndromesinsus atelectasisopacified sinus", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2488_synpic24858", "MPX2488_synpic24859", "MPX2488_synpic24860"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2488_synpic24858", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2488_synpic24858.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "mild ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.", "age": "13", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2488_synpic24859", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2488_synpic24859.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Normal frontal sinuses.", "age": "13", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.2", "figure_part": null}, {"image_id": "MPX2488_synpic24860", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2488_synpic24860.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Head and Neck", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "- occluded left infundiblulum.\n\n- opacified small left maxillary sinus.\n\n- retraction of lateral wall mid turbinate with widened middle meatus.\n\n- left septal deviation.", "age": "13", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.2", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n13 year old with chronic sinusitis, worse for last 3 weeks.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nunremarkable\n\nImaging Findings:\nOpacified atelectatic left maxillary sinus with infundibular occlusion.

Although choledocholithiasis (bile duct stones) represents a diagnostic possibility in almost any setting of biliary stone disease, certain risk factors should be elicited from the patient to develop a diagnostic perspective.\n\nIn the setting of jaundice, elevated serum bilirubin, and pancreatitis, a dilated common bile duct is should lead to a careful search for distal obstructing stones.  Up to 15% of patients having cholelithiasis, also have choledocholithiasis.  The size of the extrahepatic bile duct is the most sensitive means of determining obstruction (whether seen or unseen).  Furthermore, although there are some special cases, CBD should measure less than or equal to 4mm + 1mm per decade after 40.\n\n\nUltrasound remains up to 95% sensitive in the detection of cholelithiasis. However, detection of common duct stones remains at approximately 80%.  Certain maneuvers (drinking water, using compression with the US probe) and certain positions (RPO, R lateral decubitus) can assist with detection.  Sometimes the overlying bowel & gas can obscure imaging by ultrasound.  A level and cause of the obstruction needs to be obtained to guide the need for further tests, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  Options include MR cholangiogram, CT, and endoscopic procedures.\n\nAbout 90% of biliary obstructions and subsequent biliary ductal dilatation occur distally and are caused by 3 entities:\n1) pancreatic carcinoma\n2) choledocholithiasis\n3) chronic pancreatitis with stricture formation\n\nIf the diagnosis is uncertain then further diagnostic studies should be undertaken to better delineate these etiologies. \n\nComplications of choledocholithiasis include strictures, complicatiosn of operative procedures, and cholangitis.   \n\nAlthough the clinical setting will dictate—especially in the presence of infection—stones < 6mm typically can pass on their own.

Most patients will have an acute clinical presentation.  The blood will, therefore, be hyperdense (white) on a plain CT scan.  The most common source of bleeding is a laceration or tear in one of the meningeal arteries that feed the dura itself.  Posterior or occipital epidurals may develop from lacerations of the dural transverse sinus.\n\nMore than 90% of patients with an EDH will have a skull fracture (and associated scalp trauma) in addition to the EDH.  The temporal bone and the underlying middle cranial fossa are the most commonly affected areas. Because of the firm fixation of the dura to the suture, the hematoma only rarely crosses a cranial suture.\n\nSome patients are knocked unconscious by the initial head impact (a \"concussion\") - but then wake up and may appear normal.  This is often described as the \"lucid interval\" and occurs in about 40% of patients with epidural hematoma.\n\nDr. Paul Cooper, in his book \"Head Injury\", reports these five patterns of the clinical EDH:(U=unconscious; L=lucid; C=conscious)\n\n1. U-->L-->U: 11 to 67%\n2. U throughout: 19 to 56%\n3. U-->C: 16 to 26%\n4. C-->U: 7 to 21%\n5. C throughout: 9 to 25%\n6. unknown or unstated: 5%\n\nNOTE: A significant number of patients do not even have a transient loss of consciousness. (Data courtesy of Vern Armbrustmacher).\n\nAs the blood accumulates from bleeding meningeal arteries, it forms a bi-convex or lens shaped mass that pushes the brain inward and downward - causing brain herniation.\n\nThe acute formation of the EDH often causes secondary downward transtentorial brain herniation.  This, in turn, may cause neurologic signs,including oculomotor nerve (CNN-3) dysfunction and a \"blown pupil\" (fixed and dilated).\n\nMany patients have the injury, but appear to be alright afterwards.  As the blood accumulates and the brain begins to shift, they may slip into a coma.  This is \"lucid interval\" is also sometimes described as \"Talk and Die\".  Sadly, this is not rare, and in 2009 Tony Award winning actress Natasha Richardson died from an epidural hematoma.  She had a lucid interval after falling while skiing, not wearing a helmet.\n•  http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=talk-and-die-richardson\n•  http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Movies/story?id=7119825&page=1'>http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Movies/story?id=7119825&page=1\n•  http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/03/18/brain.injury/index.html?iref=mpstoryview\n•  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/19/AR2009031902515.html\n•  http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/health/bal-epidural-hematoma-0318,0,7024060.story\n•  http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Movies/story?id=7119825&page=1\n\nFor more on Intracranial Hemorrhage: http://rad.usuhs.mil/rad/handouts/jsmirnio/Intracranial_Hemorrhage_%20RSNA_2008_HO.pdf\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30XPVg0DWH4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiscvATspCA", "keywords": "TBI Traumatic Brain Injurylucid interval", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2427_synpic4861", "MPX2427_synpic4862"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2427_synpic4861", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2427_synpic4861.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Rt temporal-occipital epidural hematoma with mild mass effect on right lateral ventricle.", "age": "5", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "-1.-1", "figure_part": "1b"}, {"image_id": "MPX2427_synpic4862", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2427_synpic4862.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Rt temporal-occipital epidural hematoma with mild mass effect on right lateral ventricle.", "age": "5", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "-1.-1", "figure_part": "1c"}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n5 year old male S/P fall from shopping cart.

The are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumors with an estimated 1.5 clinical cases per 100,000.  Autopsy case incidence is higher at 650 per 100,000.  \n \nOver 2/3 of carcinoid tumors are in the GI tract, but can also occur in lungs, ovaries, testes, mediastinum, kidneys, etc.  More than 95% of GI carcinoids originate in only 3 sites: appendix, ileum, and rectum.  Carcinoids are most often benign, but those affecting the ileum and bronchus are frequently malignant.  \n\nCLINICAL FEATURES: \nSigns and symptoms vary depending on size, location, and metastases.  Most tumors are slow growing and asymptomatic until late disease.  Metastatic disease can occur but is not common.  Carcinoid tumors can be endocrinologically inert or secrete several hormones (serotonin, histamine, kallikrein, insulin, etc) which are responsible for carcinoid syndrome (cutaneous flushing, venous telangiectasia, diarrhea, bronchospasm, cardiac valvular lesions).   \n\nDIAGNOSIS: \nMany carcinoid tumors are found incidentally on endoscopic or radiographic procedures.  The most useful test for carcinoid syndrome is to measure 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-HIAA.  Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the tumor must be localized using abdominal CT and indium-111 octreotide imaging.  If metastases are suspected, then use of CT or MRI is recommended to rule out liver metastases.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nCarcinoid crisis - life threatening form of carcinoid syndrome that results from the release of extremely high amounts of biologically active compounds (catecholamines, etc) from the tumor.

Simple parapneumonic effusions are uninfected, free-flowing fluid collections. Complicated parapneumonic effusions are early infected fluid collections prone to develop loculations by fibrinous septations. Empyema is a collection of frank pus within the pleural space. An effusion is termed complex when it develops loculations. The natural evolution of untreated simple and complicated parapneumonic effusions is to become complex and to progress to frank empyema with development of a residual cavity or entrapment of the lung by a fibrous peel or cortex.\n\nPneumonia results in parapneumonic effusion in approximately 45% of cases, although less than 5% of these progress to an empyema. Other common causes include mediastinal or pulmonary surgery and trauma. Less frequently, empyema may result from spread of infection from adjacent structures. Mortality from empyema ranges from 1% to 20%. \n\nClinical manifestations vary, depending on the underlying pulmonary process, the responsible organism, the quantity of bacteria and fluid in the pleural space, the stage of the disease, and the host defense mechanisms. The clinical presentation can range from an absence of symptoms to a severe febrile illness with toxemia and shock. In general, it is difficult to distinguish patients with infected pleural effusions from those with sterile parapneumonic effusions on the basis of history and physical examination alone. Clinical manifestations include fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough with mucopurulent sputum. Physical examination often reveals decreased breath sounds, dull percussion, and restricted respiratory excursions. \n\nWith the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-1940s, a significant shift occurred in the microbiology of pleural space infections. Anaerobic organisms are now the most common bacteria isolated from infected pleural effusions, being identified in up to 75% of cases, either alone (35%) or in combination with aerobic organisms (40%). Up to 35% of established empyemas have negative Gram stain evaluations and many patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions have negative culture results. Staphylococcus aureus is a relatively common cause of empyema in otherwise healthy adults, children and in patients who have had chest trauma or prior surgery, whereas alcoholic males are particularly susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. \n\nThoracentesis plays a critical role in the management of pleural effusions and in 90% of adult cases yields useful information. Fluid is removed and samples obtained for measurement of pH, glucose, LDH, protein, and differential cell count. An exudate is defined by: (1) a ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein greater than 0.5, (2) a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH greater than 0.6, or (3) a pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds of the upper normal limit for serum or >200 IU [3] . A transudate does not meet any of the above three criteria. \n\nIf the patient has a transudative effusion, no further laboratory tests on the pleural fluid are indicated. If the patient has an exudative pleural effusion, the remaining pleural fluid is sent for WBC and differential, cytologic examination, Gram's stain and cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacteria and fungi if clinically indicated. The aspiration of frank pus confirms the presence of empyema and establishes an absolute indication for urgent drainage of the pleural space. In this instance, Gram's stain and culture are the only laboratory studies necessary to guide initial therapy. Pleural fluid Gram's stains can identify pathogens in 55% to 65% of patients with established empyemas. \nThe posterior-anterior and lateral chest radiographs are the best initial diagnostic modalities. When the patient is upright, free pleural fluid first accumulates in the lowest part of the hemithorax—the posterior costophrenic angles. Lateral decubitus views allow detection of 50 to 100 ml of fluid and the presence of loculations if the fluid fails to layer out along the dependent chest. In the view with the involved side superior, the free fluid layers against the mediastinum and one can assess how much of the radiodensity is due to the fluid and how much is due to a parenchymal infiltrate. In the view with the involved side dependent, the amount of free pleural fluid can be semi-quantitated by measuring the distance from the chest wall to the outside of the lung. If the thickness of fluid exceeds 10 mm, a diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated. However, it is not necessary to tap all parapneumonic effusions, especially if the volume of fluid remains small, the patient is doing well, the fluid moves freely, or serial roentgenograms show improvement. \n\nCT is of great value in the overall evaluation of parapneumonic effusions and should be done early in the assessment of patients with complex parapneumonic effusion or empyema. CT is helpful in (1) differentiating pleural fluid from peripheral parenchymal infiltrates or pleural thickening, (2) evaluating the parenchymal disease, (3) determining the presence of loculations, (4) characterizing the pleural surfaces, and (5) guiding and assessing therapy. Complicated effusions and empyemas are frequently associated with nearby pulmonary consolidation and can be mistaken for a lung abscess. A lung abscess usually presents as a poorly defined, roughly spherical mass surrounded by consolidated but non compressed lung. An empyema is usually elongated, conforms to the shape of the chest wall, and compresses the adjacent lung. Its wall is thin and uniform and the interface angle with the chest wall is obtuse. The margins of the empyema cavity are composed of inflamed visceral and parietal pleura that enhance after administration of intravenous contrast. The visceral and parietal layers are separated by the interposed empyema fluid, giving rise to the “split pleura sign”.\n\nUS is widely available, provides guidance for thoracentesis or pleural catheter placement, and can be transported to the bedside. US is particularly useful for sampling fluid that does not layer freely on decubitus films, and can distinguish solid from liquid pleural abnormalities better than chest roentgenography. The presence of discrete pleural septations has prognostic importance because loculated collections require drainage for their resolution. Computed tomography, however, gives additional information not obtained by US.\n\nThe sine qua non of empyema management is early, adequate, and dependent drainage. The therapeutic armamentarium for parapneumonic effusion or empyema consists of antibiotic therapy, thoracentesis, chest tube drainage, image-guided percutaneous catheter drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic agents, and a variety of surgical drainage procedures, including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy.", "keywords": "empyemaeffusionthoracentesis", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2608_synpic20532"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2608_synpic20532", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2608_synpic20532.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Axial CT of the chest demonstrates a large left sided pleural fluid collection with surrounding enhancing rind consistent with an empyema.
