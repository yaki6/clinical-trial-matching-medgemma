Treatment options for these patients include a variety of surgical options: choroid plexectomy, opening of a stenotic auqaduct, tumor removal (in cases where tumor mass is causing obstruction), fenestration of the floor of the third ventricle, and shunting.  Of these, shunting represents the most common and successful procedure.  Essentially shunts provide a conduit for CSF to drain from the ventricles or subarachnoid space to another compartment of the body.  A variety of options exist, but the preffered route is the ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  Shunts require routine follow up, and in children, revisions on a scheduled basis according to growth rates.

It is thought to result from\nfailure of compaction of the myocardium during development. Patients have variable age at presentation from birth to the 4th decade of life, with earlier presentations portending a worse prognosis. There has been no predilection for race or sex elucidated to this point.  Both familial and sporadic cases have been documented, demonstrating isolated LVNC and presentations associated with other\ncardiac anomalies.  The patient in this case has a history which points to a familial form; however, no formal testing exists as research into potential mutations is ongoing.\n\nDiagnostic parameters with echocardiography have been used as the gold standard since being described by Chin et al.(1) and later by Jenni et al.(2).  However, more recent advances in MR and CT imaging now allow for comparable if not superior imaging(3) of left\nventricular trabeculations characteristic of the disease, especially in the apical region.\n\nLVNC is underdiagnosed as a result of lack of knowledge about the disease and screening of relatives of those presenting with LVNC (4).  Though echocardiography has historically been the diagnostic test of choice, MR and more recently CT have been shown to be complimentary or superior in detecting the characteristic, 2-layered myocardium (5).  MR offers high quality images, preventing misdiagnosis of the characteristic trabeculations as apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or other cardiac pathology.  It allows for acquisition of images in any plane without limitations of acoustic windows and has been utilized to diagnose cases that went undetected by echocardiographic exam.\n\nMR has been found to be diagnostic of LVNC at a ratio of noncompacted to compacted myocardium > 2.3 at the end of diastole, with sensitivities and specificities of 84 and 99% (6).  Furthermore, MR delayed hyperenhancement correlates with degree of wall motion abnormality and has been found to be a positive independent predictor of ejection fraction and disease severity (7).  Others have used the ratio of 2.3 as the basis for CT diagnosis of LVNC (8-10), finding a good correlation to MR results.  CT is advantageous over other modalities in its ability to exclude anomalies of the coronary vasculature which have been described with LVNC (11).

While it is true that headaches are sometimes seen with stroke, this patient had no focal neurologic findings at the time of his presentation, which confused the picture.  His headache presentation was most consistent with migraine, if one assumes a primary headache.  If one looks further for causes of secondary headache, the differential includes subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), aneurysm, acute ischemic cerebrovascular disorder, arteritis, artery dissection, hypertension(HTN), pseudotumor cerebri, infection, and substance use or withdrawal.  \n\tIn this case, the team did a CT for bleeding including SAH and mass effect, which was negative, blood work to rule out arteritis and infection, and (later) an MRA to examine the arteries, which was also normal everywhere but the L PICA. Physical exam and lumbar puncture ruled out pseudotumor cerebri in this case. That leaves HTN, ischemia/infarct, and substance or drug use or withdrawal.\n\tThe patient's systolic blood pressure was elevated on presentation, and with further digging, continued to remain elevated during his hospital course (with diastolic also elevated most of the time). It is possible that his blood pressure had been elevated for quite some time, leading to an occult risk factor.  If his headache was a caused by a hypertensive crisis, one would expect his blood pressure to be further elevated on presentation. \n\tThe patient was taking Effexor (venlafaxine), which is a Selective Serotonin/ Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor(SNRI), and has both HTN and headaches as possible side effects.  Stroke is not listed as a known side effect.  However, there is one case study in the literature that describes a patient having a \"migraine-like\" stroke while having a serotonin syndrome.  Serotonin syndrome is caused by too much serotonin in the brain, usually secondary to patients taking SSRIs/ SNRIs and then taking a second serotonin promoter.  It does sometimes occur when patients are taking elevated doses of medication.  It is unknown how long this patient was taking Effexor before his headaches began or if he experienced any of the other symptoms of serotonin syndrome, including acute mental status changes, involuntary movements, altered muscle tone, and autonomic instability.  Even if the patient did not have serotonin syndrome on presentation, it is worth noting that he received sumatriptan while in the hospital, while also receiving his venlafaxine.   Could this combination have precipitated a serotonin syndrome?  Certainly, however, the patient did not report an increase in symptoms after receiving the drug, so the possibility is very slim.\n\tCocaine is also associated with stroke in the younger population.  It is associated with vasoconstriction, and has been known to cause slow flow in the vertebrobasilar system (which supplies the PICA), among other cerebral infarcts, and HTN.  While this patient does not report any cocaine use, it is a possibility to be entertained.\n\tThe actual cause of this patient’s infarct may never be known, in part because we do not know when the actual infarct occurred.  CT best demonstrates signs of cerebral infarct at least 24 hours after the event.  There are cases of CT being used to identify infarcts earlier, but this is generally by identifying secondary signs (like a clot in the MCA) and in the cerebrum rather than the cerebellum.   The differential for headaches is very broad, but stroke must be kept in mind especially when no other obvious cause presents itself, as it can often be reversed if found early enough.\nReferences:\nClinch,CR.

The pain was sharp, but throbbing and located behind his left eye and radiating posteriorly. The nausea and vomiting began just after lunch, and shortly after the patient took a motrin for his headache. He denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, recent ill contacts, or diarrhea. The patient was given ativan, morphine, phenergan, zofran and benadryl along with a 1L bolus of NS. CT was performed and determined to be negative for acute pathology. On day 2, the headache had resolved in the AM, but IV phenergan was required for nausea, and the dizziness persisted. The patient reported a headache in the afternoon, unresolved with 2 separate doses of Imitrex (sumatriptan), but partially alleviated with Tylenol. The patient continued to experience pain the following day, so a repeat CT was done, which showed a “probable left cerebellar infarct”.\nPMHx: Hypertriglyceridemia, psoriasis, anxiety, G6PD, Crohns\nMeds: Lopid (gemfibrozil), Effexor (venlafaxine)\nAllergies: Iodine, Primaquin", "topic_title": "Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Infarct", "acr_code": "1.9", "category": "Hypoxic or Ischemic", "disease_discussion": "Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Infarction\n\nThe posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory includes all of the posteroinferior cerebellum, the ipsilateral cerebellar tonsil, and the ipsilateral inferior vermis.

As of submission date, the patient continues to be in the diagnostic stages of medical care and planning.  \n\nSurgery is likely to be planned, as most of these primary bone tumors must be removed by en bloc resection.  Despite their benign taxonomy, a majority of these benign lesions tend to recur, therefore making wide excision standard regardless of malignant potential.", "discussion": "Paraspinal masses can invoke an enormous list of differential diagnoses: lymphoma, metastatic disease, nerve sheath tumors, primary bone tumors, myeloma, meningocele, cysts, abscesses, and beyond.  Based on location and radiographic appearance, this particular patient's findings suggested a neoplastic process, which directed him to biopsy.  Indeed biopsy results initially indicated that a primary bone neoplasm was probable, based on presence of osteoblasts and cartilage.\n\nPrimary bone tumors are relatively rare, with an incidence of approximately 10,000 cases a year in the US.  Using the patient's demographics as well as radiographic features can narrow the differential significantly.  The suspected neoplasms, with the exception of chondrosarcoma, fit this patient’s age group, as all frequently present in the second and third decades (chondrosarcoma has a peak incidence in the 5th and 6th decades of life). Using mass location to assign a probably diagnosis, an osteoblastoma becomes likely as it is often found in the spinal elements. By histology, of the differentials listed, the primary bone neoplasms seem most probable as those tumors are associated with chondro-osseous derivatives.  More distinctively, the radiographic features suggest that there is a cystic component to the tumor, likely aneurysmal bone cysts.  Because only a small fraction of the tumor contains these structures, they are likely to be secondary versus a primary aneurysmal bone cyst.\n\nWhen considering primary bone tumors with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst components, the differential is further pointed.  Only 5 types of primary bone tumors typically display this pattern:  giant cell tumor of bone, osteoblastoma, chondroblastoma, fibrous dysplasia, and telangiectatic osteosarcoma.\n\nFinal pathology reading of the core biopsy revealed the tumor was a chondroblastoma.  This is a very rare tumor, and even rarer is the location of the tumor in this patient.  Chondroblastomas account for less than 1% of all bone tumors; this corresponds to approximately 100 cases a year, considering the scarcity of primary bone tumors in general.  Additionally, nearly 75% of the cases occur in the long bones of the lower extremity - distal femur and proximal tibia/fibula.  Another 20% of chondroblastomas occur in the humerus, while a small fraction has also been reported in the small bones of the hand and feet.  Case reports have described these tumors occurring in the skull, mandible, maxilla, vertebra, ribs, scapula, patella, and sternum.\n\nThis patient fits the expected demographics of the majority of primary bone tumors: second decade in age, male, black, history of chronic pain.  What is so profound regarding this case remains the specific type of primary bone tumor, given its rarity by statistical incidence, and its unusual location originating from the ninth rib.\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nBullough, Peter.

It is a common complication of congestive heart failure and constrictive pericarditis, wherein elevated central venous pressure is directly transmitted from the right atrium to the hepatic veins because of the their close anatomic relationship.  The liver becomes tensely swollen as the hepatic sinusoids dilate and engorge to accommodate the back flow of blood.  Liver dysfunction arises from a combination of decreased hepatic blood flow, elevated hepatic venous pressure, and diminished arterial oxygen content, resulting in hepatocellular hypoxia.\n\nHepatic changes are manifested as hepatomegaly, ascites, jaundice, and abdominal pain caused by stretching of the liver capsule.  Transient abnormalities of the liver-associated enzymes include elevations of serum bilirubin, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time. The transaminase levels are typically elevated 20-fold but normalize rapidly over several days.  Passive hepatic congestion typically occurs in elderly individuals with right-sided congestive heart failure and low cardiac output.  Precipitating factors include cardiac ischemia, dysrhythmias, cardiac or extracardiac infection, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, noncompliance with medical therapy, and dietary indiscretion, to name a few.  Symptoms include weakness, shortness of breath, and right upper quadrant pain. \n\nLaboratory:\n\nIn right-sided heart failure, hyperbilirubinemia may be evident, and the transaminases are moderately elevated.  Occasionally, there is isolated elevation of cholestatic enzymes.  In left sided failure, there is a more marked elevation of  serum bilirubin and of transaminases, which rapidly return to normal when congestive heart failure is treated.\n\n\nSonographic Evaluation:\n\nPatients normally demonstrate inferior vena caval and hepatic venous triphasic flow patterns.  The first two peaks are toward the heart and are reflections of right atrial and ventricular diastole.  The third peak is a short period of reversed blood flow, accompanied by atrial systole.  As central venous pressure rises, the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins dilate because the failing right atrium cannot accommodate the venous return.  Clinically, this is manifested by a hepatojugular reflux on physical examination.\n\nWith elevated central venous pressure, the hepatic veins lose their triphasic pattern.   In long-standing disease, a unidirectional, low-velocity, continuous flow pattern may be seen.  Mixed flow patterns can also be seen on color flow Doppler sonograms. \n\nNormal portal venous flow is steady and continuous except for a mild increase during expiration.  In patients with passive hepatic congestion, the energy of the elevated pressure from the right atrium and hepatic veins is transmitted directly via the dilated hepatic sinusoids into the portal vein.  The result is that portal venous blood flow becomes pulsatile, because the liver no longer prevents changes in central venous pressure from reaching the portal circulation.\n\nAdditionally, sonographic evaluation of the gallbladder may demonstrate diffuse gallbladder wall thickening, which is a nonspecific finding, found in a variety of conditions unrelated to intrinsic gallbladder disease.  Edema of the gallbladder wall, as seen in congestive heart failure, is likely secondary to elevated portal venous pressure, elevated systemic venous pressure, and decreased intravascular osmotic pressure.  However, passive edema of the gallbladder wall may be difficult to differentiate from other causes of gallbladder wall thickening such as an acute inflammatory process in the right upper quadrant, acute pancreatitis, perforated duodenal ulcer, hepatitis, right-sided diverticulitis, and acute right-sided pyelonephritis. \n\nWhen the above findings are considered with other ancillary findings of congestive heart failure to include cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, hepatomegaly, and ascites, one should have little difficulty in arriving at the proper diagnosis of passive hepatic congestion secondary to congestive heart failure.", "keywords": "Hepatic Congestion secondary to Congestive Heart FailureHepatic Congestion", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1592_synpic40521"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1592_synpic40521", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1592_synpic40521.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Gastrointestinal", "location_category": "Abdomen", "caption": "Unenhanced axial CT image through the level of the heart demonstrates small bilateral pleural effusions.", "age": "71", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "7.6", "figure_part": null}], "llm_prompt": "Clinical History:\n71 yo female with elevated liver-associated enzymes, and concern for cholelithiasis.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nLaboratory:\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase:  689 \nGGT: 369 \nAST: 60\nALT: 62\n\nBNP: 218 H\n\nImaging Findings:\nSonographic evaluation of the gallbladder demonstrates diffuse gallbladder wall thickening.

In a young child, metastatic disease is very uncommon - and thus this girl was followed with repeat imaging that documented a stable lesion size - now, most likely a healed granuloma.", "topic_title": "Solitary Pulmonary Nodule - Calcified Granuloma", "acr_code": "65.2811", "category": "Differential Diagnosis", "disease_discussion": "One of the most common tasks in the daily life of a radiologist is assessing new solitary pulmonary nodules. By definition, a solitary pulmonary nodule is an opacity, 3 cm or less in diameter, without associated mediastinal lymphadenopathy or atelectasis. Lesions larger than 3 cm in diameter usually are defined as masses.   Most of these represent bronchogenic carcinomas. But even a smaller nodular opacity may represent a relatively early and potentially curable primary bronchogenic carcinoma. The task of the radiologist is to distinguish such a lesion from common benign causes of a pulmonary nodule, especially a granuloma or hamartoma. Proper evaluation is important so that expeditious surgical removal of a potentially curable bronchogenic carcinoma can be accomplished, while concomitantly avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for the benign conditions. In some surgical series, <50% of resected nodules are due to a malignant neoplasm. \nThe initial evaluation of the suspicious nodule should begin with a comparison of any obtainable previous chest radiographs. Absence of growth for two years generally is indicative of a benign lesion. \n\nLesion calcium and contour are important clues to the nature of a solitary pulmonary nodule.  Calcium is easy to recognize when it is deposited in a distinctive pattern—such as a central nidus, in concentric rings, or in a popcorn-like configuration—because of the contrast difference with noncalcified areas of the nodule. But it is much more difficult to ascertain when the calcium is distributed diffusely throughout the lesion in a homogeneous fashion. Since density on a radiographic film is an imprecise parameter, the determination of the calcium content of a nodule that appears homogeneous on standard radiography is often quite subjective. \n\nIn most situations when the plain chest radiograph demonstrates a suspicious nodule, CT should be used because it is the most effective, objective, and widely available radiologic technique to further assess the nature (shape, borders, and density) of a presumed solitary pulmonary nodule. Furthermore, simultaneous assessment of the mediastinum and chest wall is achieved, along with comprehensive evaluation of both lungs. Not infrequently, other pulmonary nodules are detected in the patient suspected to have a single lesion on chest radiography. The alternatives generally available besides CT are surgical resection via thoracotomy or thoracoscopic wedge resection, needle biopsy, or the much less desirable approach of obtaining frequent serial radiographs to monitor possible growth of the lesion.\n\nThe basic assumption underlying the use of CT densitometry is that the presence of calcification in a well-circumscribed pulmonary nodule is a strong indicator of a benign lesion because granulomas contain greater amounts of calcium much more frequently than malignant neoplasms. Obviously, CT would not be warranted in an attempt to distinguish a benign granuloma from a metastasis in a patient who has had a primary osseous or soft-tissue sarcoma (e.g., osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma) or a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma (e.g., colon, ovary, or breast) that might calcify. Also, metastases that have a propensity to bleed (e.g., choriocarcinoma or melanoma) may have higher CT numbers than soft tissue because of fresh hemorrhage or calcification induced by prior bleeding, but such lesions almost always have irregular margins. \nOccasionally, other features are detected that permit confident diagnosis of a benign lesion, such as lucent areas of fat within the nodule consistent with a hamartoma. Adjacent small satellite nodules suggest a benign etiology, most typically granulomatous infection. Lesions that are not truly nodular on CT, but rather linear or ovoid, also are usually benign. \n\nWhile there are no pathognomonic radiologic features of a malignant pulmonary lesion, thin section CT may strongly suggest that a small peripheral nodule represents a primary lung carcinoma. An outer margin that has a spiculated interface with lung or is hazy and less dense than centrally due to lepidic growth favors a malignant neoplasm. An endobronchial component, convergence with a peripheral pulmonary vein, or focal pleural retraction toward the lesion are additional signs suggesting a malignant lesion. A heterogeneous internal composition, especially with small areas of necrosis, supports the diagnosis of a carcinoma. Small air bronchograms, or focal bubble lucencies (air bronchiolograms), in a poorly marginated pulmonary nodule are more common in a malignant lesion, especially bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, and sometimes lymphoma; however, these findings may also occur in benign inflammatory masses. If the lesion is probably malignant, a subsequent or preceding standard post-contrast-enhanced CT examination of the thorax and upper abdomen should be obtained for comprehensive staging, including a search for additional lung lesions.\n \nThe margins of the lesion must be relatively smooth in order to confidently diagnose a benign lesion, since a small percentage of primary bronchogenic carcinomas may contain foci of dystrophic calcification. Such calcification, usually eccentric and stippled, is most typically found in larger lesions that almost always have markedly irregular margins. Relatively large and central carcinoid tumors also may contain foci of calcification; a clue to the proper etiology is their central location immediately adjacent to a secondary bronchus. Most calcified granulomas are in the periphery of the lung. Hamartomas, which also may be peripherally located, can contain calcification. It is sometimes characteristically popcorn or chondroid-like, and at times may be detected in conjunction with fat in the lesion.\n\nBecause thinly collimated scans are noisier and subject to greater statistical variation and it is known that malignant neoplasms may contain calcification, it is generally judicious to obtain follow-up chest radiographic study in 3 to 6 months to corroborate that the calcified nodule depicted on CT has a stable growth pattern. \n\nThe presence or absence of enhancement after intravenous contrast administration may contribute further data in predicting the etiology of a well-circumscribed homogeneous nodule that remains indeterminate.  Similarly, FDG PET imaging, which assesses metabolic activity, may have equivalent or superior efficacy in separating a benign from a malignant nodule.", "keywords": "granuloma", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1793_synpic41476", "MPX1793_synpic41478"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1793_synpic41476", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1793_synpic41476.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "There is a left upper lobe pulmonary nodule which measures approximately 1.1 cm in diameter.", "age": "10", "sex": "female", "acr_codes": "6.3", "figure_part": "3a"}, {"image_id": "MPX1793_synpic41478", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1793_synpic41478.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT w/contrast (IV)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Chest, Pulmonary", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "There is a left upper lobe pulmonary nodule which measures approximately 1.1 cm in diameter.

Differentiating portal venous from biliary gas may be difficult on plain films, however usually portal venous gas will be seen to within 2cm of the peripheral edge of the liver, while biliary gas generally appears more centrally.

Most ameloblastomas occur in the ramus and posterior body of the mandible (80% of cases) and patients usually present with a slow-growing, painless mass. Although usually considered benign, ameloblastoma can demonstrate locally aggressive behavior.\n\nAmeloblastoma is typically expansile with an osseous shell that represents the involved bone. They can perforate the lingual cortex of the mandible and extend into the adjacent soft tissues. Ameloblastomas can vary in radiographic appearance. Some appear as well-defined, unilocular, well-corticated, lucent lesions that are often associated with the crowns of impacted or unerupted teeth.  \n\nAs a result, a unilocular ameloblastoma  may be radiographically indistinguishable from odontogenic keratocysts and dentigerous cysts. Other ameloblastomas are multilocular with internal septa and a honeycomb or soap bubble appearance and are often similar in appearance to large odontogenic keratocysts. Definitively diagnosis is by histological evaluation. \n\nTreatment of ameloblastoma depends on the extent of tumor infiltration through the cyst wall and into surrounding bone. Excision of a relatively contained ameloblastoma could involve localized removal of the lesion with wide margins; if the lesion is highly infiltrative and extensive, en bloc resection would be performed.

CLE is a rare congenital malformation. It was diagnosed in 10 of 70 patients with congenital malformations of the lung seen from 1970 to 1995 at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC. Depending upon the pattern of referrals, other tertiary medical centers may treat one or two cases per year.  Males appear to be affected more than females, in a ratio of 3:1.  The reason for the male predominance is unknown.  Progressive lobar hyperinflation is likely the final common pathway that results from a variety of disruptions in bronchopulmonary development. These result from abnormal interactions between embryonic endodermal and mesodermal components of the lung. Disturbances may lead to changes in the number of airways or alveoli or alveolar size. However, a definitive causative agent cannot be identified in approximately 50 percent of cases. The most frequently identified cause of CLE is obstruction of the developing airway, which occurs in 25 percent of cases.  Airway obstruction can be intrinsic or extrinsic, with the former more common. This leads to the creation of a \"ball-valve\" mechanism in which a greater volume of air enters the affected lobe during inspiration than leaves during expiration, producing air trapping.\nIntrinsic obstruction often is caused by defects in the bronchial wall, such as deficiency of bronchial cartilage. This results in airway collapse during expiration. Intraluminal obstruction caused by meconium or mucous plugs, granulomas, or mucosal folds can cause partial obstruction of a lower airway. Extrinsic compression may be caused by vascular anomalies, such as a pulmonary artery sling or anomalous pulmonary venous return, or intrathoracic masses, such as foregut cysts and teratomas.  CLE is characterized by overdistention of one or more lobes of the lung.  This leads to compression of the remaining lung tissue and herniation of the affected lobe across the anterior mediastinum into the opposite chest, causing displacement of the mediastinum.

CT has the best sensitivity and specificity if done both with and without intravenous contrast, with narrow window settings, and with 1-cm continuous sections.  The disadvantages include expense, radiation, time, intravenous contrast, and poor visualization of lesions near the diaphragmatic dome.\n\nUltrasound is comparable to CT in sensitivity and specificity.  It is usually less expensive, fast, has no radiation exposure, and allows excellent visualization of lesions near the diaphragms using longitudinal views.  Disadvantages include difficulty with obese patients and those with excessive bowel gas, and a strong technical dependence (e.g., using the proper focal length or frequency of transducer).  Both CT and ultrasound have the advantage of visualizing multiple organs in the search for a primary lesion.\n\nScintigraphy has the lowest specificity and sensitivity but is fast, relatively inexpensive, and has few technical dependencies.  Disadvantages are a low specificity, visualization limited to the liver and spleen, poor visualization of small or deep lesions, and limited usefulness in the face of underlying hepatocellular disease.\n\nEach modality has specific advantages that can be applied to particular situations.  For example, ultrasound is ideal for lesions in the left lobe or near the dome of the liver and at times can define small lesions not seen with other methods. Other lesions may be better seen with CT; however, this is usually not predictable in advance.  In general, scintigraphy is the least informative of the three techniques.\n\nLiver function tests are used as the initial screening for hepatic metastases.

The perforation is thought to result from a dramatic increase in intra-esophageal pressure caused by such activities as coughing, retching, heavy lifting or even parturition.  The perforation usually occurs in the left posterior aspect of the lower esophagus near the gastro-esophageal junction. Patient presentation includes severe chest pain after straining in up to 95% of cases and hematemesis in up to 30%.  It occurs 5 times more commonly in males.  Chest X-ray classically shows pneumomediastinum and pleural effusion.  The effusion tends to be greater on the left. Chest radiographs are said to be abnormal in up to 90% of cases of esophageal perforation although abnormalities \nmay be non-specific and may not be evident immediately after the perforation occurs. Other radiographic findings that may result from esophageal perforation include subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal air-fluid levels, mediastinal widening, pneumothorax, hydrothorax, or pulmonary infiltrates. CT allows more sensitive evaluation for mediastinal fluid and air in addition to pleural effusion.  Radiographic \ncontrast study of the esophagus may show the site of perforation although the false negative rate has been reported as high as 10%.  The study can be done with water-soluble contrast and/or thin barium depending on the preference of the cardiovascular surgeon. The risk of using water-soluble contrast is pulmonary edema if patient aspirates, \nand the risk of using barium is reportedly barium mediastinitis if barium leaks into the  medistinum through a large perforation. \nOf the various causes of esophageal perforation, postemetic spontanous perforation is considered the most morbid secondary to massive contamination and frequently delayed diagnosis. This is in contrast to iatrogenic injuries which are frequently diagnosed at the time of injury. The reported mortality with early primary repair varies widely ranging from 43% (even if the condition is diagnosed and treated less than 24 hours after perforation) to as low as 5% in some reports.  The most important factor in regards to morbidity is the length of time between perforation and repair. On occasion with very small contained perforations the cardiovascular surgeon may elect conservative management, but in the majority of cases immediate surgical repair is necessary.  Conservative management is associated with a 22 to 38% mortality. The difficulty with nonoperative management is prospective determination of which perforation will remain contained and which will cause continued contamination with subsequent uncontrolled infection.

These tumors usually occur in the seventh decade of life.  \n\nCurrently, computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used imaging method in the assessment of pancreatic tumors. The sensitivity of CT detection of pancreatic tumors is reported to be more than 90% when direct or indirect signs are used for diagnosis[1]. However, the potential to differentiate exocrine (non-endocrine) tumors of the pancreas is limited. \n\nOn non-enhanced CT imaging, there is often a slightly decreased attenuating pancreatic mass seen. Following rapid bolus of contrast injection, the tumor usually appears as a hypodense mass with ill-defined borders. Calcification is almost never present within the mass. Indirect signs of a pancreatic mass include abrupt obstruction of the common bile and/or pancreatic duct and atrophy of pancreatic tissue beyond the tumor. The typical distribution of ductal cell adenocarcinoma is as follows: 60–70% at the pancreatic head, 10% the body, 5% the tail, 5% both head and body, and about 10% body and tail [1]. \n\nThose who present with a pancreatic head mass often have symptoms earlier than in those with pancreatic tail masses, mainly due to symptomatic obstruction of the biliary or pancreatic duct.

Numerous clinical conditions predispose to PE, including recent surgery (within 3 months), immobilization, thrombophlebitis, and underlying malignancy or other causes of a hypercoagulable state.   In women, pregnancy and use of estrogen are known risk factors.\n\nThe clinical presentation is often variable, and nonspecific, and dependent upon the size and number of emboli occluding the pulmonary circulation.  The classic presenting triad of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis is infrequently encountered.  The majority of patients presenting with PE demonstrate tachypnea, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough.  Patients may have a feeling of impending doom.  Tachycardia is commonly present.  Less commonly, patients may demonstrate wheezing, hypotension and syncope.\n\nThe D-dimer blood test is a screening tool for PE.  If a serum level less than 500 ng/L, further evaluation with imaging is unnecessary since the post-test probability of PE is 5% or lower.\n\nThe radiographic findings are often nonspecific and depend on whether the pulmonary emboli are associated with infarction. Abnormalities seen include an increase in the size of the central pulmonary arteries because of the presence of a large embolus.  Local oligemia may be present in the area distal to the PE.  Westermark’s sign is when oligemia involves an entire lung secondary to a proximal clot.  A small pleural effusion may be evident. In severe cases acute cor pulmonale may be seen with cardiac enlargement and prominence of the superior vena cava and azygos vein.  Other findings include an elevated hemidiaphragm on the affected side, small pleural effusions, atelectasis with linear opacities, and occasionally Hamptom’s hump, which is a pleura-based , wedge-shaped density may be evident.\n\nThe source of PE is most commonly from deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity.  Treatment most commonly consists of anticoagulation, which prevents clot propagation and allows endogenous fibrinolytic activity to dissolve existing thrombi.  Anticoagulation decreases mortality from 30-60% to less than 5%.  \n\nPrior to the advent of CT angiography, V/Q studies had been the mainstay for screening symptomatic patients for the presence of pulmonary embolism.  A normal perfusion scan excludes PE with a negative predictive value close to 100%.  A low-probability V/Q scan combined with a low-probability clinical assessment results showed PE in only 4% of patients.  A high-probability V/Q scan in a patient with high-probability clinical findings showed PE in 96% of patients.  With other combinations, PE was present in 16%-88% of patients requiring further evaluation.  \n\nThe V/Q scan is safe, widely available, and is an alternative chest imaging technique for patients who cannot undergo CT angiography.

Tissue pathology, however, is usually obtained to definitively distinguish between the two and rule out more rare renal pathology in this age group such as renal cell carcinoma.\n\n\nFeature\t                Neuroblastoma\t               Wilms Tumor\nAge\t               Most common <2yrs             Peak at 3 yrs\nGrowth                   Surrounds/engulfs               Grows like ball     \n                                vessels                                 displacing vessels\nRelation to kidney\tInferiorly displaces             Arises from kidney\n                                                                                \"claw sign\"\nLung metastasis\tUncommon\t          More common (20%)\nVascular invasion\tDoes not occur\t       Invasion of renal vein/IVC \n                                                                        is common\nCalcification\tCommon (85% on CT)\tLess common (15%)\nAdapted from Donnelly, 2008.\n\nThere are two predominate schools of thought in regards to staging and treatment of Wilms tumor.  The Nation Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) advocates for a surgery up-front approach allowing for a more accurate histologic and tumor extent assessment. The International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) advocates for chemotherapy first which reduces tumor volume and likely the possibility of tumor spillage during removal.  Both stratagies use their own somewhat complicated staging system but generally follow the more simplistic outline below.  \n\nI.\tConfined to kidney\nII.\tExtension into perinephric spaces\nIII.\tLymphnode involvement\nIV.\tMets to liver/lung\nV.\tBilateral kidney involvement\n\nIt is important to note that due to the differences in surgical timing and variations in criteria a “stage to stage” comparison of the two staging systems is confounded. It is also important to note the histologic characteristics are felt to be a more powerful prognostic indicator for Wilms.\n\nThe prognosis for Wilms tumor is generally good with excellent results obtained with a combination of nephrectomy and chemotherapy in most cases. Survival rates are reported as high as 90% which includes tumors that have spread beyond the kidney.

Despite its histologic complexity, LSMFT has a relatively characteristic radiologic appearance and skeletal distribution [1]. \n\nLSMFT is usually an incidental finding. According to Gilkey [2], they have a broad adult age range, but quite likely have their inception in childhood and slowly alter their appearance over a lifetime. In the majority of instances asymptomatic discovery, lack of distortion of bone outline, and sclerotic borders are indications of stability over many years. Other lesions gradually enlarge, predisposing to pathologic fracture. \n\nThe designation of \"sclerosing\" refers to the intralesional bone formed or mineralized within altered fat. The term \"myxofibrous\" refers to the fibrous or myxofibrous areas. \n\nThe radiologic appearance of LSMFT is often quite characteristic. LSMFT has a striking predilection for the femur: In a study by Kransdorf, et al, approximately 85% of the lesions were at this site, and 91% of the femoral lesions were in the intertrochanteric region. Radiographs typically showed a geographic lesion with a well-defined, often extensively sclerotic margin. The bone contour was normal or showed mild expansile remodeling. Mineralization within the lesion was not uncommon. \n\nLSMFT can be readily distinguished from intraosseous lipoma on CT scans or MR images by the identification of fat within a lipoma. Intraosseous lipomas do occur in the proximal femur, and the differentiation between LSMFT and intraosseous lipoma with involutional change may not be possible on imaging studies. Similarly, in some cases, differentiation between infarct and myxoma may not be possible. \n\nMalignant transformation in lipomatous lesions has been well documented. The prevalence of malignant transformation in LSMFT has been previously reported to be 10%–16%. The increased propensity of LSMFT for malignant transformation is likely to be secondary to its extensive involutional and ischemic change, with the associated sarcoma arising from areas of ischemic ossification within the lesion or from progressive in situ atypism of the altered lipomatous elements. \n\nIn summary, LSMFT of bone is a lesion characterized by a complex admixture of histologic patterns. Although LSMFT is not unique in terms of histogenesis, it is distinctive in terms of its morphologic and characteristic radiologic appearances and skeletal distribution. The apparent increased risk of malignant transformation associated with LSMFT underscores the need for close observation of this condition.", "keywords": "liposclerosing; myxofibrous; tumor; bone; lipo; sclerosing; myxo; fibrous; LSMFT", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX1531_synpic16441"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1531_synpic16441", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1531_synpic16441.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - noncontrast", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Axial CT scan through the middle portion of the lesion shows mineralized matrix.

Sixty five percent of patients that have symptoms of acute appendicitis for longer than 48 hours present with perforation of the appendix due to significant inflammation and necrosis. Perforation of the appendix can cause widespread intraperitoneal contamination or a sealed-off abscess, and can be lethal if not promptly recognized. The size of the perforation, the virulence of bacterial infection, and the ability of the infection to be contained will determine the extent of the inflammatory response. Abscesses are variable in size, have low attenuation numbers (10 to 30 Hounsfield units) and may display an identifiable capsule which signals chronicity. If the abscess is due to gas-forming bacteria or fistulization to bowel occurs, bubbles of air or air-fluid levels may be observed.  Abscesses may be found in locations distant from the cecum due to variable position of the appendix and the patterns of fluid migration in the peritoneal cavity. Most abscesses are located inferior, medial, or posterior to the cecum or in the right paracolic gutter.  \n\nIt has been suggested that imaging is not necessary if a patient presents with history and physical exam strongly suggestive of acute appendicitis. However, imaging is advisable for the patients with atypical symptoms, infants, small children, and young women\n\nRadiographs demonstrate some abnormality in up to 80% of patients with acute appendicitis. Appendicoliths are the most specific radiographic sign, but are only found in 10% of patients with acute appendicitis. However, when an appendicolith is present, the incidence of perforation is nearly 50%. Appendicoliths can be differentiated from bone islands, ureteral stones and pheleboliths by their calcified rims.  In cases of retrocecal appendicitis, the appendicolith may be located in the right upper quadrant. Other radiographic findings suggestive of acute appendicitis are: cecal ileus, right lower quadrant fluid levels, paucity of right lower quadrant gas, distortion of flank stripe, loss of psoas margin, loss of properitoneal flank stripe, thickening of cecal wall, scoliosis, mottled gas collection in right lower quadrant, and pneumoperitoneum\n\nHigh resolution or helical CT techniques have been shown to be superior to radiographs in establishing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis due to high accuracy and sensitivity. CT scans have accuracy of 96% to 98%, sensitivity of 96% to 100%, specificity 95% to 97%, a PPV of 97% to 99%, and a NPV of 88% to 100%\nThe diagnosis of appendicitis can be made with confidence when an abnormal appendix is identified or when an appendicolith associated with a phlegmon or abscess is detected in the right lower quadrant.  The abnormal appendix appears slightly distended, fluid filled structure about 0.5 to 2cm in diameter.  In almost all cases of acute appendicitis, the appendiceal wall may display circumferential and asymmetrical thickening. Periappendicieal inflammation is another hallmark of acute appendicitis. The inflammatory response is variable and may show the following: Slightly increased hazy density of the mesenteric fat, linear strands, fluid containing abscesses, or heterogeneous ill defined soft tissue densities representing a phelgmon. A summary of findings of acute appendicitis seen on CT scan are listed below:\n\nCircumferential mural thickening of appendix \nMural contrast enhancement\nAppendicolith\nHazy, streaked periappendiceal densities\nPericecal soft tissue mass (phlegmon)\nPericecal fluid collection (abscess)\nMural thickening of adjacent cecum and terminal ileum “Arrowhead sign”\nCecal bar\nFocal cecal apical thickening\nEnlarged lymph nodes\nPneumoperitoneum\n\nIn patients without acute appendicitis CT is also useful as it is able to diagnose other intra abdominal conditions.

This gap should be differentiated from the muscular gap in the posterior portion of the cricopharyngeus, the site of development of a Zenker's diverticulum. \n\nBoth Zenker's diverticulum and Killian-Jamieson diverticula occur at locations of anatomic weakness in the hypopharynx or cervical esophagus near the cricopharyngeus muscle. In contrast to the Killian-Jamieson diverticulum, a Zenker's diverticulum originates on the posterior wall of the pharyngoesophageal segment in a midline area of weakness just above the cricopharyngeus.  On pharyngoesophagography, it is seen lying posterior to the cervical esophagus on lateral images and in the midline on frontal images. In contrast, the Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is seen lying lateral to the cervical esophagus on frontal images and overlapping the anterior wall of the cervical esophagus on lateral images. \n\nThe diagnosis of either type of diverticulum is based primarily on the radiographic findings rather than on endoscopy. While endoscopy may identify the opening of a either type of diverticulum, its location in relation to the cricopharyngeus muscle is best seen when passage of the barium bolus outlines the protruding cricopharyngeus. The size of the sac and the relationship of the sac to the cervical esophagus are also best evaluated on barium studies. Therefore, the two forms of diverticula can be differentiated on the based upon the radiographic findings. \n\nStudies indicate that Killian-Jamieson diverticula are less common and considerably smaller than Zenker's diverticulum.

Acute and/or chronic subdural hematomas and cerebral contusion are common in child abuse.  Intracerebral hematomas and epidural hematomas are uncommon.\n\nUntreated acute subdural hematomas undergo a series of predictable pathologic changes.  Soon after the acute hemorrhage, the blood collection becomes surrounded by endothelial cells and there is invasion by granulation tissue.  Progressive liquefaction of the hematoma results in its conversion to a serous fluid.  These serous subdural collections are referred to as chronic subdural hematomas or subdural hygromas.  Chronic subdural hematomas, related to prior trauma, are most often located adjacent to one or both cerebral convexities but may also extend into the interhemispheric fissure.\n\nThe CT appearance of a subdural hematoma varies according to the time period since the injury.  The initial hemorrhage is visualized as a high-attenuation fluid collection on CT.  The attenuation values of the lesion progressively decrease over the next weeks to months.  Chronic subdural hematomas usually contain serous fluid and produce attenuation values slightly greater than those of CSF.  It is not uncommon for an abused child to have suffered multiple episodes of trauma, resulting in intracranial hematomas in different stages of evolution.\n\nAt times, chronic subdural hematomas are difficult to differentiate from enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces.  In many cases, a distinct transition is visible between the subdural fluid collection and the slightly lower attenuation CSF of the subarachnoid space.  A membrane of variable thickness separating the two spaces may be identifiable.  The brain adjacent to a chronic subdural hematoma is often displaced, and the sulci may be compressed and effaced.  In contradistinction, enlarged subarachnoid spaces are associated with interdigitation of the fluid into the cerebral sulci.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of isolated chronic subdural fluid collections in infants includes bacterial meningitis, remote trauma, rickets, and Menke's syndrome.

Most cervical spine injuries occur in males age 15-24.  \n\nRadiology:  Atlas pathology can be detected by plain film images, especially with the odontoid, or open-mouth, view where lateral displacement of greater than 6.9mm is indicative of a fracture.  However, this modality has low sensitivity so diagnosis is facilitated by computed tomography(CT). Magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) is indicated for investigating soft tissue injury, such as when ligamentous disruption is suspected or when there are neurologic deficits.  Arteriography may be necessary to evaluate vascular injury.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment:  Isolated posterior arch and non- or minimally-displaced Jefferson fractures are considered stable.  Treatment is a rigid cervical collar for 8-12 weeks with follow-up imaging to re-evaluate stability.  The patient is expected to resume normal activity once the fracture has healed.

The mechanism of the hyperflexion injury is usually a significant force directed against the occiput, forcing the face towards the chest, and resulting primarily in distraction of the posterior structures, with a lesser force vector resulting in compression of the anterior column.  The spectrum of injuries ranges from the relatively stable “hyperflexion sprain” to the unstable flexion injuries (flexion teardrop fractures and bilateral locked/jumped facets).  \n\nThe “hyperflexion sprain” is a ligamentous injury associated with varying degrees of disruption of the posterior ligaments (progressively involving the supraspinous ligaments, interspinous ligaments, facet joint capsules, and posterior longitudinal ligament, respectively), usually without associated fractures.  These patients present with persistent pain, muscle spasms and, occasionally, mild reversible neurologic defects.  Radiographic abnormalities, when they are present, include widening of the interspinous distance or posterior aspect of the apophyseal joints, and/or localized kyphotic angulation of the cervical spine. \n\nOccasionally, a pure hyperflexion injury of the cervical spine completely spares the posterior ligaments and results only in osseous disruption of the anterior column, manifesting as either avulsion of the anterior portion of the superior vertebral ring (in the immature skeleton) or simple compression fractures of one or more vertebrae (in adults).\n\nAnother stable hyperflexion injury of the C-spine is the clay-shoveler’s fracture, an oblique fracture of one or more of the spinous processes of the sixth cervical through third thoracic vertebrae, from avulsion by the supraspinous ligament.\n\n============== UNSTABLE INJURY ================\nAs previously mentioned, bilateral locked/jumped facets are one example of an unstable hyperflexion injury and result from rupture of the posterior portion of the annulus fibrosus, the posterior longitudinal ligament, and the capsular, interspinous, and supraspinous ligaments.  Destabilization of the ligamentous support-structure of the spine allows such severe anterolisthesis of the cephalad portion of the cervical spinal column that facet locking occurs, with resultant severe narrowing of both the spinal canal and intervertebral neural foramina.  Consequently, this injury pattern is invariably associated with neurologic deficits (75 percent of cases).  The radiographic hallmark of bilateral jumped/locked facets is greater than 50% (half the width of the vertebral body) of anterior displacement of the superior vertebra, as demonstrated on the lateral radiograph.  Associated osseous injuries include avulsion fractures of the spinous process above the locked level, and triangular fractures of the anterosuperior corner of the inferior vertebral body.\n\nA second type of unstable hyperflexion C-spine injury is the flexion teardrop fracture, which typically results from the combination of flexion and axial loading.  This injury manifests radiographically as an anteroinferior (teardrop) fracture fragment of a lower cervical vertebra (most commonly C5).  The teardrop fragment may be large and frequently retains anatomic alignment with the adjacent inferior vertebral body or shows minimal anterior and downward displacement, while the larger posterior fragment shows posterior displacement relative to the vertebra below.  Frequently, concomitant sagittal fractures through the vertebral body and laminae (associated with axial loading) are also present.\n \n=============== ADDITIONAL PEARLS:  \n\nIf the flexion force is associated with a rotational component, either a unilateral perched facet or a unilateral locked facet may result..  This category of C-spine injuries accounts for approximately 12% of the total.\n\nThe other C-spine hyperflexion injuries are: anterior subluxation, vertebral compression, flexion teardrop fracture, and spinous process (clay shoveler’s) fracture.", "keywords": "flexion injuriesjumped facetslocked facets", "ct_image_ids": ["MPX2512_synpic19965"], "mri_image_ids": [], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2512_synpic19965", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2512_synpic19965.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "CT", "modality": "CT - Montage", "plane": "Sagittal", "location": "Spine", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "CT reconstructed sagittal plane of the cervical spine demonstrates bilateral locked facets at C5-6 level.

Enchondromas are usually singular, but multiple lesions may occur in enchondromatosis syndromes such as Ollier’s, Maffucci’s and metachondromatosis.  Enchondromas are a benign finding seen incidentally on plain radiographs MRI, and/or CT while investigating other pathology.\n\nTypically, patients are 20-40 years old when the tumor is identified.  The patient with any of the enchondromatosis syndromes is typically younger when the first lesion is identified. There is no gender or racial predilection.\n\nIn the United States, enchondromas account for 12-14% of benign bone neoplasms and 3-10% of osseous neoplasms in general. They are most commonly found in the diaphyses of the hands and feet, and less commonly in the femur, humerus, or tibia.  Enchondromas present as small (<5 cm) lytic masses which have a pattern of lobulated arcs and rings indicative of their chondroid matrix.  When found in the larger bones, they are usually metaphyseal, centrally located and can have a sclerotic margin.\n\nFrequently plain radiographs are adequate to identify and diagnose enchondromas.  Occasionally, further imaging such as CT or MRI may be required to offer a more complete picture of the bone surrounding the tumor.  Bone scans are usually ineffective in the diagnosis of enchondromas as typical findings of mildly increased uptake are non-specific.\n\nEnchondromas are benign but can cause pathologic fractures or can rarely progress to chondrosarcoma. This malignant transformation is of concern due to the destructive changes which occur in high grade tumors as well as the 5 year survival rate which is as low as 15% in high grade tumors.   \n\nTumors found in the hands and feet have a virtually negligible transformation rate while those seen in the long and flat bones should be monitored more closely for transformation. Transformation to malignancy occurs much more frequently in patients with enchondromatosis. \n\nThe following radiographic changes are suggestive of this transformation to chondrosarcoma:\n• \tScalloping of the inner surface of the bone\n• \tThickening of the bone cortex\n• \tReactive bone growth on the outer surface of the bone\n• \tErosion surrounded by reactive bone\n• \tNoticeable growth in the bony erosion\n• \tMRI may identify cortical extension and extension to the soft tissue mass.\n\nWith the exception of enlarged digits when hands and feet are involved, physical exam of the patient with an enchondroma is usually unremarkable. Pain found on exam is attributable to either adjacent but non-related pathology, pathologic fracture resulting from the enchondroma, or should raise the clinical suspicion for progression to chondrosarcoma.\n\nDifferential diagnosis varies depending on whether calcifications are present.  In cases in which they are, bone infarct which may exhibit a serpiginous lining and low grade chondrosarcoma must be considered.  If the lesion is purely lytic, however, non-ossifying fibroma, simple bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, eosinophilic granuloma, and clear cell chondrosarcoma should be considered. \nWhen considering these diagnoses, the following factors are each used to rule out the diagnosis in question:\n• \tNon-ossifying fibroma – usually cortically based, enchondromas are medullary based\n• \tSimple bone cyst – usually seen before age 20\n• \tEosinophilic granuloma – also seen commonly in patients before age 20\n• \tFibrous dysplasia – has a ground glass appearance on imaging\n• \tClear cell chondrosarcoma – epiphyseally based, with extension into the metaphysis usually seen on MR\n\nWhen asymptomatic, treatment of enchondromas consists of observation.

Usually, the matrix of the lucency is smooth and relatively homogeneous; classically, this finding is described as a ground-glass appearance. Irregular areas of sclerosis may be present with or without calcification. The lucent lesion has a thick sclerotic border and is called the rind sign.\n\nFollow-up:\nMalignant degeneration, Estimated frequency is 0.4-1%.\nThe interval from the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia to the development of malignancy varies and is usually years or decades.\nMost often, skull and facial bones undergo malignant change in monostotic disease, whereas femoral and facial bones undergo malignant change in polyostotic disease.\nOsteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma are the most common tumors. Chondrosarcomas occur less frequently.\nRadiographic features suggestive of malignant degeneration include a rapid increase in the size of the lesion and a change from a previously mineralized bony lesion to a lytic lesion. Clinical findings of increasing pain and an enlarging soft-tissue mass suggest malignant change.\n\nMetabolic changes, Hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia have been noted in patients with fibrous dysplasia. \nOne hypothesis to explain the associated metabolic disorder suggests that lesions such as fibrous dysplasia synthesize phosphaturic hormone.", "keywords": "Polyostotic Fibrous DysplasiaFibrous DysplasiaRind Sign", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1781_synpic50581", "MPX1781_synpic50633", "MPX1781_synpic50634", "MPX1781_synpic50635", "MPX1781_synpic50636", "MPX1781_synpic50637"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1781_synpic50581", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1781_synpic50581.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - T1W - noncontrast", "plane": "Coronal", "location": "Musculoskeletal", "location_category": "Spine and Muscles", "caption": "Multifocal, predominantly cystic multiloculated circumscribed bony lesions spare the humeral epiphyses, the largest proximal metaphyseal lesion measuring approximately 5.2 cm in its maximum diameter.

Patients with BAV are at increased risk for a variety of complications that includes aortic valvular disease, endocarditis, ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection [1-4].  There is also an association of BAV with coarctation of the aorta [5,6].  While this BAV-coarctation relationship is widely known to exist in patients with Turner syndrome, this is also seen in non-syndromic individuals.  \n\nThe detection of a bicuspid aortic valve is often incidental, but once found requires routine surveillance for its associated complications.  Echocardiography remains the initial study of choice for most patients.  However, MRI, capable of functional evaluation using cine bright blood techniques and of aortography using MRA, is well suited for further evaluation of patients with BAV for associated valvular and aortic conditions.\n\nFunctional impairment of the aortic valve—namely aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation—is the most common complication (in up to 68-85% of patients [1,3]) seen in patients with BAV.  Aortic stenosis may manifest as a systolic ejection murmur, best heard in the second right intercostal space.  Aortic insufficiency, on the other hand, is characterized by a decrescendo diastolic murmur, best heard at the left sternal border.  On echocardiography, of course, the severity of the valvular stenosis or insufficiency and co-existence of a BAV is typically evident.  \n\nPatients with BAV also have an increased incidence of aortic disease [7-11].  While it is well known that aortic valvular dysfunction is associated with increased risk for aortic aneurysm, patients with BAV appear to have additional risks for aortic disease.  Nistri et al. [12] reported significant aortic root enlargement in healthy patients with normally functioning BAV when compared to healthy subjects with normally functioning tricuspid aortic valves.  Similarly, Hahn et al. [2] report significantly larger aortic root sizes in patients with BAV at all grades of valvular dysfunction when compared to subjects with tricuspid aortic valves matched for age, gender and grade of valvular disease.  These studies suggest that the predisposition for aortic disease in patients with BAV is due to factors other than, or in addition to, traditional hemodynamic considerations.  \n\nDe Sa et al. [8] and others [7,9,11] have reported severe degenerative changes, such as cystic medial necrosis, elastic fragmentation and alterations of smooth muscle orientation, in the media of the ascending aorta of patients with BAV.  Moreover, de Sa et al [8] found more severe degenerative changes not only in the media of the ascending aorta but also in the pulmonary arteries of patients with BAV, compared to that of patients with tricuspid aortic valves.  These studies suggest that the association of BAV with aortic disease results from a common developmental error and not only hemodynamic forces.  \n\nIn patients with aortic dilatation and BAV, the risk for aortic rupture and aortic dissection are considerably higher [13].  The risk for aortic dissection, in particular, has been reported to be increased 5 to 9 fold in patients with BAV [10,14].  For this reason, some surgeons have advocated more aggressive and earlier elective surgical repair in patients with BAV, aortic valvular dysfunction and aortic dilation [13].  \n\nThe clinical presentation of patients with BAV varies and depends on the presence and severity of its associated complications.  Often the finding is incidental, such as being found during a routine echocardiogram for evaluation of suspected aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency.  On occasion, it is identified during the evaluation of a dilated aorta as in this case.  Alegret et al. [15] reported BAV in 20 percent of their patients with aortic root dilatation.  Echocardiography will continue to be the initial study of choice in most instances.  However, with the increased use of MRI in the evaluation of aortic pathology, the evaluation of the aortic valve should be considered during an MRI study especially in instances of aortic dilatation or in cases where there is suspicion or known aortic valvular dysfunction.  \n\nOn MRI, aortic caliber is best evaluated using ECG-gated black blood pulse sequences (Figures A-D).  Note that these images are typically performed during diastole and measurements may not necessarily correlate exactly with echocardiographic measurements.  The aortic valve, on the other hand, is best seen using cine bright blood acquisitions, notably steady state free precession (SSFP; also known as TrueFISP, FIESTA and balanced FFE).  To evaluate valvular function, cine images should be performed perpendicular to the left ventricular outflow track (Figure E).  To evaluate the number of valve leaflets, imaging using cine SSFP (or cine phase contrast, Figure F) images should be performed parallel to the aortic valve plane.  The determination of BAV is made by the configuration of blood flow across the actual aortic valve.  In patients with BAV, the aortic valve orifice is shaped like a lens (Figure F); in patients with a tricuspid aortic valve, like a triangle.  \n\nMRI is well suited for the determination of aortic caliber and valvular pathology, but can also reliably detect aortic dissection [16].  This can be performed using a combination of black and bright blood pulse sequences.  However, contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA (Figure G) can particularly improve the diagnostic confidence for the diagnosis or exclusion of an intimal tear and or aortic coarctation [17].", "keywords": "bicuspid aortic valvecardiac MR", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX2218_synpic30796", "MPX2218_synpic30797", "MPX2218_synpic30800", "MPX2218_synpic30801", "MPX2218_synpic30802"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX2218_synpic30796", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX2218_synpic30796.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - Other Pulse Seq.", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Cardiovascular", "location_category": "Thorax", "caption": "Figure C.

The incidence is similar between male and female, with perhaps a slight female predominance.  Pilocytic astrocytomas are, by definition, low-grade (WHO grade I) tumors.  They are well circumscribed lesions and may be cystic, solid or both.  The cystic form is seen in greater than 75% of lesions and has a classic appearance of a mural nodule in a cyst.  With MRI, the mural tumor appears iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hyperintense on T2-weight images.

These highly malignant tumors usually arise in the midline in the posterior fossa (85%).  Medulloblastoma appears hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 and enhances with contrast.  It may appear well-circumscribed but is often found to be invasive at the margins on histology, often invades the fourth ventricle and will seed the subarachnoid space – necessitating surveillance of the spinal cord.

Prior to discharge from the hospital, the Orthopaedic team discussed various treatment options with the patient, to include a left-foot-transmetatarsal amputation, left-foot-first-ray amputation, left-below-the-knee amputation, and continued antibiotics with dressing changes.  The patient had follow-up appointments scheduled with the Vascular-Surgery Service (tissue oxygen pressure evaluation and wound monitoring) and with the Orthopaedic-Surgery Service (wound care and monitoring, and further discussion of surgical options).", "discussion": "A prevalent sequela of diabetic foot ulcers is osteomyelitis.1  In fact, almost all diabetic foot infections originate from an ulcer (> 85%), making prompt diagnosis and aggressive management essential in preventing later amputation.2  A diabetic’s peripheral neuropathy causes “decreased pedal sensation that leads to undetected mechanical and thermal injuries; excessive and repetitive pressure on plantar bony prominences, especially the metatarsal heads; gait disturbances and foot deformities that increase focal pressure; and autonomic neuropathy that leads to decreased sweating and dry, cracked skin.”1  This coupled with a diabetic’s peripheral vascular disease, peripheral motor neuropathy, dysfunctional immune system, and poor wound healing, increases the likelihood of an organism gaining a foothold in and causing an infection of the underlying bone.1\n\nWhile osteomyelitis in an otherwise normal patient would present with fever, chills, and local signs of infection (i.e., purulent drainage, erythema, warmth, and tenderness), the diabetic patient with osteomyelitis of the foot may be devoid of any or all of these symptoms.1  Often, “recalcitrant hyperglycemia is the only systemic sign” of osteomyelitis of the foot, and fever and chills are absent in up to 67% of infected patients.1  In short, the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis in this setting is poor.1  Therefore, clinicians must either resort to a bone biopsy or use diagnostic imaging.  A bone biopsy is a surgical procedure, is time consuming and not without risk, and is expensive, whereas imaging is essentially noninvasive, provides rapid results with very little risk to the patient, and relative to surgery is inexpensive.  Therefore, it is the modality used to make a diagnosis in these patients, although biopsy is occasionally needed for confirmation, particularly when patients have neuropathic joints and osteomyelitis.\n\nRadiographs of the foot are the easiest and least expensive imaging studies.1  However, “the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot are 60% and 66% respectively.”1  Unfortunately, osteomyelitis must be present for 10 to 21 days before the infection is detectable on plain radiographs and a patient with severe neuropathic bone disease will have a similar appearing study.1  However, radiographs should be the initial imaging study, not only due to its ease and economy, but also as a baseline.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test for diagnosing osteomyelitis with a sensitivity and specificity of 99% and 83% respectively and demonstrates excellent contrast between the soft tissues and bones and pathological conditions such as osteomyelitis, myositis, and cellulitis.1  The main drawback of MRI in this role is cost.1  On T1-weighted MR images of the bone marrow, osteomyelitis causes a decreased signal intensity, but T2-weighted MR images with fat saturation and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) MR images of involved bone marrow will show an increased signal intensity.1,3  On contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images with fat saturation, areas of osteomyelitis will enhance.  MRI can also detect the diabetic ulceration, and sometimes the sinus tract from osteomyelitis to ulcer.  The addition of contrast-enhanced MRI allows the detection of nonenhancing necrosis, which is important to recognize for debridement.\n\n1. Schinabeck MK, Johnson JL.

Microbes can reach bone by three mechanisms: hematogenous spread, extension from a contiguous site of infection, and direct introduction of organisms into bone by trauma and surgery.  \n\nAcute hematogenous osteomyelitis involves bone with red marrow.  In children, most commonly affected are the long bones with relatively slow flow in metaphyseal sinusoidal veins and a paucity of phagocytes.  Infection is often secondary to staphylococcal skin infections.  In adults, acute osteo rarely involves the long bones because adipose tissue has replaced red marrow.  Instead, it most commonly occurs in vertebral bodies, where the marrow is cellular and has abundant vascular supply.  Septicemia is usually the inciting event.\n\nExtension from a contiguous site of infection is a common cause for osteomyelitis.  Infection following trauma, radiation therapy, burns or pressure sores.  In patients with vascular insufficiency, organisms can enter the soft tissues through a cutaneous ulcer, often in the foot, and cause cellulitis, then osteomyelitis.\n\nDirect introduction of organisms into the bone may occur during open fractures, open surgical reduction of closed fractures, or penetrating trauma by foreign bodies such as bullets.  May also arise from perioperative  contamination of bone during laminectomy, diskectomy, or joint prosthesis.

The most common long-term sequelae of PCA strokes are visual and sensory deficits.  In general, patients with PCA distribution strokes exhibit less overall chronic disability than those with anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, or basilar artery infarctions.\n\nIschemic strokes occur when blood cannot flow to cerebral structures.  Neuron metabolism tolerates a brief period of interrupted oxygen and glucose delivery.  Cell death is imminent after approximately 6 minutes of halted blood circulation.  Large cortical neurons are especially sensitive to ischemia.  Infarcts include a central area, or umbra, of highly concentrated cell death, surrounded by a penumbra of tissue containing stunned cells that may recover, assuming circulation is reestablished or produced through nearby collaterals.\n\nThe right and left PCA vessels are formed from bifurcation of the basilar artery near the junction of the pons and midbrain over the ventral aspect of the brainstem and each PCA is divided into four segments (P1-P4)\nP1: extends from origin of the PCA to the posterior communicating artery (PCOM)\nP2: includes from junction with PCOM to its major branch, the lateral posterior choroidal artery, which supplies the posterior thalamus\nP3/P4: distal segments of the PCA whose branches circulate blood to cortical regions, most importantly the undersurface of the temporal lobe, the posterior 1/3 of the interhemispheric surface, occipital pole, visual cortex, and splenium of the corpus callosum.\n\nAnatomic localization of the point of vascular occlusion in the PCA infarcts may be simplified into (1) DEEP or PROXIMAL PCA strokes, causing ischemia in the thalamus and/or midbrain (regions supplied by P1 and P2), as well as in the cortex (regions supplied by P3 and P4); and (2) SUPERFICIAL or DISTAL PCA strokes, involving only cortical structures (P3,P4 branch areas)\n\nPatients with PCA infarcts present with symtptoms such as:\n- acute vision loss\n- confusion\n- new onset posterior cranium headache\n- paresthesias\n- limb weakness\n- dizziness\n- nausea\n- memory loss\n- language dysfunction\n\nThe most common examination finding is a homonymous visual field cut, usually a complete hemianopia, caused by a lesion in the contralateral occipital lobe.\n\nDeep or proximal PCA infarcts involve portions of the thalamus and midbrain.  Thalamic lesions result in contralateral face and limb sensory loss.  The midbrain cerebral peduncle carries corticospinal tract fibers that decussate caudally in the brainstem.  A peduncle lesion is associated with contralateral motor weakness.  Large or bilateral PCA infarcts that involve thalamus, temporal, and/or parietal-occipital lobes often result in a spectrum of possible findings (neuropsychologic deterioration and memory, language, or visual-cognitive dysfunction)\n\nMajor etiologies of PCA infarction include cardiac embolism, vertebrobasilar disease, and PCA atherothrombosis.\n\nhttp://rad.usuhs.mil/medpix/medpix.html?mode=single&recnum=3748&table=card&search=vascular+map#top\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Display&dopt=pubmed_pubmed&from_uid=10773642", "keywords": "strokeinfarct", "ct_image_ids": [], "mri_image_ids": ["MPX1007_synpic46719", "MPX1007_synpic46720", "MPX1007_synpic46721", "MPX1007_synpic46722"], "images": [{"image_id": "MPX1007_synpic46719", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1007_synpic46719.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - DWI Diffusion Weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "First DWI slice of R PCA ischemia and periventricular hyperintensities.", "age": "89", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.9", "figure_part": "1a"}, {"image_id": "MPX1007_synpic46720", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1007_synpic46720.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - DWI Diffusion Weighted", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "Second DWI slice of R PCA ischemia and periventricular hyperintensities.", "age": "89", "sex": "male", "acr_codes": "1.9", "figure_part": "1b"}, {"image_id": "MPX1007_synpic46721", "file_path": "MedPix-2-0/images/MPX1007_synpic46721.png", "on_disk": true, "type": "MR", "modality": "MR - ADC Map (App Diff Coeff)", "plane": "Axial", "location": "Brain and Neuro", "location_category": "Head", "caption": "First ADC map slice of R PCA ischemia without notable periventricular lesions.

It is more common in the elderly and there is a slight increased risk among children and siblings of multiple myeloma patients.  There is also an increased incidence amongst petroleum, leather, and cosmetology workers.  Additionally, exposure to radiation (greater than 50 rad), hebricides, insecticides, heavy metals, plastics, and asbestos also increases risk.  \n\n“Punched-out” lytic lesions are a common finding on plain film.

Chronic hypernatremia should be corrected slowly due to the risk of brain edema which may lead to brain herniation, permanent neurologic deficits and lysis of myelin. In this case, the time course of the hypernatremia was unknown. Typical presentation is usually neurologic deterioration 48-72 hours after the sodium level has been corrected. Pseudobulbar palsy and spastic quadriplegia are two of the physical findings often associated with the syndrome.
