  "patient_note": "## Clinical History\nAn 86-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, dementia, and depression was transferred from his assisted living facility for a three-week history of decreased oral intake, dry cough, increased confusion, and recent hypotension. He was admitted for bilateral pneumonia and malnutrition.\n\n## Physical Exam\nThe patient is an 86-year-old, well-developed but poorly nourished male with dementia, who is a poor historian. He complains of cough and poor appetite. Pulmonary exam reveals bilateral rales and rhonchi. The cardiovascular exam is notable for an irregular rate and rhythm. His skin is pale, warm, and dry. The abdomen is non-tender and non-distended with positive bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nAxial CT of the chest demonstrates extensive bilateral pulmonary abnormalities. There are numerous, variably sized nodules and areas of consolidation throughout both lungs, more prominent on the right. These findings are superimposed on a background of severe fibrotic changes, including reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing, particularly in the lower lobes, consistent with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern. The combination is suggestive of metastatic disease in the setting of underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nThe patient is an 86-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, admitted for pneumonia and malnutrition. Labs were significant for leukocytosis (WBC 17.7) and hypoalbuminemia (Alb 2.8). Blood cultures were negative, but a respiratory culture grew Candida. A bronchoscopy confirmed a new diagnosis of metastatic Squamous Cell Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is an 86-year-old male.\n\n## Missing Info\nInformation not available in the provided record includes smoking history, cancer stage, and performance status (e.g., ECOG).",
