  "patient_note": "## Clinical History\nThe patient is a smoker presenting with cough and shortness of breath.\n\n## Physical Exam\nOn examination, the patient is cachectic with normal vital signs.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nDirect analysis of the provided axial chest CT scan reveals a large, irregularly shaped, spiculated soft tissue mass in the right upper lobe, which appears to abut the pleura. A metallic stent is also noted in the ascending aorta. The provided clinical notes state that a chest X-ray showed an ill-defined mass in the right upper lobe and a CT scan described a lobulated 4 cm mass with spiculation in the same location.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nHistological analysis of a specimen shows abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, findings suspicious for malignancy. The primary diagnosis is a right upper lobe lung mass.\n\n## Demographics\nAge and sex are not provided.\n\n## Missing Info\nPatient age, sex, and a definitive final diagnosis are not available in the provided information.",
