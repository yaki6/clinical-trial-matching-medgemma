  "agent_reasoning": "Based on the patient's profile—**43-year-old female, never smoker, with lung adenocarcinoma**—there is a very high probability (up to 60-70%) of an actionable driver mutation such as **EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or HER2**. The presence of **signet-ring cell features** is a unique histologic subtype often associated with aggressive behavior and specific molecular alterations (particularly ALK and ROS1 rearrangements).\n\nSince the patient appears to be **treatment-naive** (first-line setting), the priority is to find trials offering potent, next-generation targeted therapies that may be superior to standard chemotherapy/immunotherapy.\n\n### **Search Strategy**\n1.  **Broad Phenotype Search:** Screened for \"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\" (NSCLC) trials accepting young females.\n2.  **Driver-Specific Searches:** Targeted \"First-line\" or \"Treatment-naive\" trials for **EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and HER2**, as these are the most likely drivers in a never-smoker.\n3.  **Histology Check:** Looked for \"signet ring\" mentions (rarely specific inclusion criteria, but covered under broad adenocarcinoma trials).\n\n---\n\n### **Top 5 Clinical Trial Candidates**\n\nThese trials are grouped by the specific genetic mutation they target. The patient **must undergo comprehensive biomarker testing (NGS)** to determine which of these is the correct match.\n\n#### **1. If ALK-Positive (High Probability)**\n*   **Trial:** **Phase 3 Study of Neladalkib (NVL-655) vs. Crizotinib in TKI-Naive ALK-Positive NSCLC**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT06765109](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06765109)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** ALK fusion (common in young, never-smokers with signet-ring features).\n    *   **Design:** This is a head-to-head Phase 3 trial testing a \"4th generation\" ALK inhibitor (Neladalkib) designed to be more potent and brain-penetrant than earlier drugs.\n    *   **Fit:** Specifically recruiting **treatment-naive** patients.\n\n#### **2. If ROS1-Positive (Strong Possibility)**\n*   **Trial:** **TRIDENT-1: Repotrectinib in Patients with ROS1 or NTRK Fusions**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT03093116](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03093116)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** ROS1 fusions (highly enriched in never-smokers).\n    *   **Design:** The \"EXP-1\" cohort is specifically for **ROS1 TKI-naïve** patients. Repotrectinib is a next-generation inhibitor with high efficacy against resistance mutations.\n    *   **Fit:** Ideal for a patient presenting with advanced stage disease who needs a durable first-line option.\n\n#### **3. If HER2-Mutated (Significant Possibility)**\n*   **Trial:** **Beamion LUNG-2: Zongertinib vs. Standard of Care in First-Line HER2+ NSCLC**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT06151574](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06151574)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** HER2 (ERBB2) mutations.\n    *   **Design:** Phase 3 trial comparing a specific HER2-targeted pill (Zongertinib) directly against standard chemo-immunotherapy.\n    *   **Fit:** HER2 mutations are a distinct driver in never-smokers. This trial offers access to targeted therapy in the first-line setting, which is not currently standard of care (usually chemo first).\n\n#### **4. If EGFR-Mutated (Most Common)**\n*   **Trial:** **Amivantamab and Lazertinib in EGFR-Mutated NSCLC (CHRYSALIS-2 / MARIPOSA)**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT05498428](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05498428)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** EGFR Exon 19 Deletion or L858R.\n    *   **Design:** Evaluates the chemo-free combination of a bispecific antibody (Amivantamab) and a TKI (Lazertinib).\n    *   **Fit:** Offers a potentially chemotherapy-sparing first-line option. (Note: Check specific cohort status as this is a large multi-cohort study).\n\n#### **5. If KRAS G12C-Mutated (Less common in never-smokers, but possible)**\n*   **Trial:** **CodeBreaK 202: Sotorasib vs. Standard of Care in First-Line KRAS G12C NSCLC**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT05920356](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05920356)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** KRAS G12C mutation.\n    *   **Design:** Phase 3 comparing the KRAS inhibitor Sotorasib + Chemo against standard Chemo + Pembrolizumab.\n    *   **Fit:** Provides access to targeted therapy upfront for KRAS G12C, which is otherwise treated with chemo-immunotherapy alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Next Steps**\n1.  **Molecular Testing is Urgent:** The \"Signet-ring\" histology and \"Never Smoker\" status make **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)** mandatory. You cannot choose a trial without knowing if she is `ALK+`, `ROS1+`, `EGFR+`, or `HER2+`.\n2.  **Brain MRI:** Many of these trials (especially ALK/ROS1) have specific inclusion criteria regarding brain metastases. A baseline MRI is essential.\n3.  **Confirm Stage:** The \"pleural fluid suspicious for malignancy\" needs to be confirmed (Stage IV) to be eligible for these metastatic trials.",
