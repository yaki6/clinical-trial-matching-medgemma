  "agent_reasoning": "Based on the patient's clinical profile—specifically **young age (43)**, **never smoker** status, and **lung adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell features**—there is a very high probability of an actionable driver mutation, most notably **ALK rearrangement** or **ROS1 rearrangement**, which are strongly associated with signet-ring morphology in never smokers. **RET fusions** and **HER2 mutations** are also possibilities.\n\nSince the patient appears to be **treatment-naive** (based on the \"presents with...\" history and lack of prior treatment mentioned), the following clinical trials are prioritized for first-line therapy.\n\n### **Top Priority: ALK & ROS1 Targeted Trials (Strongest Biological Link)**\nThese trials target the specific molecular drivers most likely to be present given the \"signet-ring cell\" histology and \"never smoker\" status.\n\n*   **NCT06765109: NVL-655 (Neladalkib) for TKI-Naive ALK-Positive NSCLC**\n    *   **Phase:** 3\n    *   **Relevance:** This trial specifically recruits patients who have **not** received prior TKI treatment, making it an ideal first-line option if she is ALK-positive. NVL-655 is a next-generation ALK inhibitor designed to overcome resistance and penetrate the brain.\n    *   **Key Criterion:** Must have documented ALK rearrangement (tissue or blood).\n\n*   **NCT06564324: Taletrectinib vs. Standard Therapy for ROS1-Positive NSCLC**\n    *   **Phase:** 3\n    *   **Relevance:** Signet-ring cell features are also a hallmark of ROS1-rearranged lung cancer. This trial compares a potent new ROS1 inhibitor (Taletrectinib) against standard chemotherapy/crizotinib in the first-line setting.\n    *   **Key Criterion:** Documented ROS1 rearrangement; no prior treatment for metastatic disease.\n\n*   **NCT03093116: Repotrectinib (TPX-0005) for ALK, ROS1, or NTRK1-3 Positive Tumors**\n    *   **Phase:** 1/2 (TRIDENT-1)\n    *   **Relevance:** A \"basket\" trial that covers multiple gene fusions (ALK, ROS1, NTRK). Repotrectinib is highly potent and FDA-approved for ROS1, but this trial may offer access if the specific Phase 3 trials above are unavailable or if she has an NTRK fusion (rare but possible).\n    *   **Key Criterion:** Advanced solid tumor with ALK, ROS1, or NTRK rearrangement.\n\n### **Secondary Drivers (RET & HER2)**\nIf ALK/ROS1 testing is negative, these drivers are the next most common in young never-smokers.\n\n*   **NCT06031558: SY-5007 (RET Inhibitor) for RET Fusion-Positive NSCLC**\n    *   **Phase:** 3\n    *   **Relevance:** RET fusions occur in ~1-2% of NSCLC, predominantly in never-smokers. This trial provides a specific targeted therapy (SY-5007) for treatment-naive patients.\n    *   **Key Criterion:** Confirmed RET fusion; no prior systemic therapy.\n\n*   **NCT06452277: Sevabertinib (BAY 2927088) vs. Standard of Care for HER2-Mutant NSCLC**\n    *   **Phase:** 3\n    *   **Relevance:** HER2 mutations occur in ~2-4% of never-smokers. This trial compares a novel HER2 inhibitor against the standard chemotherapy-immunotherapy regimen.\n    *   **Key Criterion:** Documented HER2 mutation (Exon 20 insertion or TKD mutation); treatment-naive.\n\n### **Broad / Driver-Negative Options (Standard of Care + Novel Agent)**\nIf no actionable driver mutation is found (or while waiting for results), these trials add a novel agent to the standard chemotherapy + immunotherapy backbone.\n\n*   **NCT04165070: KEYMAKER-U01 Substudy 01A (Pembrolizumab + Novel Agents)**\n    *   **Phase:** 1/2\n    *   **Relevance:** Designed for **treatment-naive** Stage IV NSCLC patients. It combines the standard immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab) with various investigational agents. This is an excellent \"catch-all\" option if her tumor is \"driver-negative\".\n    *   **Key Criterion:** Treatment-naive Stage IV NSCLC; no actionable EGFR/ALK/ROS1 (usually excluded or enrolled in separate cohorts).\n\n*   **NCT06711900: SKB264 (TROP2-ADC) + Pembrolizumab vs. Chemo + Pembrolizumab**\n    *   **Phase:** 3\n    *   **Relevance:** Tests a TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate (SKB264) combined with immunotherapy in the first-line setting. This is a promising approach for patients without classic driver mutations.\n    *   **Key Criterion:** PD-L1 negative or positive cohorts likely available; treatment-naive.\n\n### **Next Steps for the Patient**\n1.  **Molecular Testing is Critical:** Her \"signet-ring\" histology is a strong predictor for **ALK** or **ROS1**. Ensure her biopsy is sent for a comprehensive NGS panel (Next-Generation Sequencing) covering ALK, ROS1, RET, MET, HER2, and NTRK immediately.\n2.  **Screening:** Most of the trials above (especially the Phase 3 ALK/ROS1 trials) will accept patients for screening and may facilitate the molecular testing confirmation.",
