  "patient_note": "## Clinical History\nA 43-year-old female presents with a six-month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion and wheezing. She denies cough, fevers, chills, or weight loss. She has no history of chronic illnesses or tobacco use.\n\n## Physical Exam\nThe physical examination revealed no abnormalities.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nAxial CT images of the chest demonstrate nodular and branching opacities in the right upper lobe, consistent with a tree-in-bud pattern. A large, well-circumscribed mass is present in the left lower lobe. Additionally, there is evidence of interstitial changes in the right lung, including honeycombing and pleural thickening, particularly in the right lower lobe, along with a small right-sided pleural effusion.\n\n## Assessment & Plan\nLaboratory analysis of fungal, acid-fast, and Gram stains showed no organisms. Pleural fluid analysis was suspicious for malignancy. Histopathologic analysis of tissue from all three right lung lobes and mediastinal lymph nodes confirmed malignancy, showing extensive lymphovascular invasion, focal necrosis, and signet-ring cells.\n\n## Demographics\nThe patient is a 43-year-old female.\n\n## Missing Info\nInformation not provided includes cancer stage, performance status, and prior treatment history.",

      "extracted_text": "Based on the provided chest CT scan, here's a description of the key findings:\n\n**Overall:** The lungs appear relatively clear, with no obvious large consolidations or effusions. The heart size is within normal limits.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n*   **Right Upper Lobe (RUL):** There is a prominent area of increased density (appearing whiter than the surrounding lung tissue) in the right upper lobe, specifically in the posterior segment. This area is irregular in shape and has spiculated margins. It is approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. This finding is highly suspicious for a mass.\n*   **Right Lower Lobe (RLL):** There is a small, ill-defined area of increased density in the right lower lobe, near the costophrenic angle. This could represent a small nodule or atelectasis.\n*   **Left Lung:** The left lung appears relatively clear, with no significant abnormalities identified.\n*   **Mediastinum:** The mediastinum appears unremarkable.\n*   **Pleura:** No significant pleural effusion is evident.\n\n**Summary:** The most significant finding is the irregular, spiculated mass in the right upper lobe, measuring approximately 1.5 cm. A smaller, less defined opacity is also noted in the right lower lobe.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided image and is for informational purposes only. A definitive diagnosis requires correlation with the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and potentially further imaging or biopsy. This is not a substitute for professional medical advice.",
