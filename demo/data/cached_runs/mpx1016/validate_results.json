This implies the patient is considered fit enough to receive systemic therapy, which often requires a reasonable life expectancy (typically > 3 months).\n\n3.

The timing is within 14 days prior to the first dose.\n\n2.

It states these values were obtained, but does not explicitly state when they were obtained relative to the first dose of treatment or if they represent *all* screening tests required by a specific protocol.\n\n3.  Does the patient have the GENERAL condition described?\n    The criterion refers to undergoing screening laboratory tests. The note provides results for several common screening labs (CBC, CMP, TSH).

However, the criterion requires *all* screening tests *as per the protocol* within 14 days prior to the first dose. The note doesn't confirm this specific requirement is met. Given the context of a clinical note detailing a patient being evaluated for treatment, it's highly likely these labs were performed recently as part of the workup, but the note doesn't explicitly confirm the timing or completeness relative to a protocol.
