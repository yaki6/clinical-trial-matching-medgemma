Taletrectinib is a next-generation ROS1 inhibitor that addresses the limitations of crizotinib (brain penetration and resistance).\n*   **Key Eligibility:** ROS1-positive; treatment-naive for metastatic disease.\n\n#### **3.

When the analysis gives a clear NO with HIGH confidence, output\n   \"not eligible\" (inclusion) or \"eligible\" (exclusion). Do NOT\n   downgrade to \"unknown\" unless you find a specific error.\n2. SEVERITY CHECK: Pay close attention to severity qualifiers in the\n   criterion (mild, moderate, severe, acute, chronic, early, advanced).\n   If the analysis mentions a DIFFERENT severity than the criterion\n   requires (e.g., criterion says \"mild\" but patient has \"severe\"),\n   the criterion is NOT met \u2014 even if the general condition is present.\n3. CONTRADICTION CHECK: If the analysis conclusion (YES/NO) contradicts\n   its own reasoning text (e.g., says \"NO\" but the reasoning describes\n   the patient clearly having the condition), rely on the REASONING\n   CONTENT to determine the correct label. If genuinely ambiguous,\n   output \"unknown\".\n\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON:\n{\n  \"label\": \"<eligible|not eligible|unknown>\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of how you mapped the clinical finding to eligibility\",\n  \"evidence_sentences\": [0, 1, 2]\n}", "max_tokens_labeling": 256, "timeout_seconds": 300.0}}

This confirms the diagnosis of malignancy.\n    - The note does not explicitly state \"NSCLC\" (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer). However, the description of the pathology (signet-ring cells, lymphovascular invasion) is consistent with NSCLC.\n    - Given the context of a clinical note, it is reasonable to assume that the confirmed malignancy is NSCLC, as this is the most common type of lung cancer.\n    - The symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing) and imaging findings (nodular and branching opacities, mass, interstitial changes) are also consistent with lung cancer.\n    - Therefore, the patient has the general condition described.\n    Answer: YES\n\n3b. **Does the criterion specify a particular SEVERITY, GRADE, or STAGE**\n    - The criterion does not specify severity, grade, or stage.\n    Answer: NO SEVERITY SPECIFIED\n\n4.  **If YES to #3: Does the criterion have additional SPECIFIC qualifiers**\n    - The criterion does not have additional specific qualifiers beyond the general condition.\n    Answer: N/A\n\n5.  **How confident are you? HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW**\n    Answer: HIGH\n\nLABEL MAPPING RULES:\n\nFor INCLUSION criteria:\n- Analysis says YES + MATCHES specifics (or N/A) \u2192 \"eligible\"\n- Analysis says YES + DOES NOT MATCH specifics \u2192 \"not eligible\"\n- Analysis says YES + SEVERITY DOES NOT MATCH \u2192 \"not eligible\"\n- Analysis says YES + INSUFFICIENT DATA on specifics \u2192 \"unknown\"\n- Analysis says NO \u2192 \"not eligible\"\n- Analysis says INSUFFICIENT DATA \u2192 \"unknown\"\n\nFor EXCLUSION criteria:\n- Analysis says YES (patient HAS the excluded condition) + MATCHES \u2192 \"not eligible\"\n- Analysis says YES + DOES NOT MATCH specifics \u2192 \"eligible\"\n- Analysis says YES + SEVERITY DOES NOT MATCH \u2192 \"eligible\"\n- Analysis says NO (patient does NOT have it) \u2192 \"eligible\"\n- Analysis says INSUFFICIENT DATA \u2192 \"unknown\"\n\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n1. When the analysis gives a clear NO with HIGH confidence, output\n   \"not eligible\" (inclusion) or \"eligible\" (exclusion). Do NOT\n   downgrade to \"unknown\" unless you find a specific error.\n2. SEVERITY CHECK: Pay close attention to severity qualifiers in the\n   criterion (mild, moderate, severe, acute, chronic, early, advanced).\n   If the analysis mentions a DIFFERENT severity than the criterion\n   requires (e.g., criterion says \"mild\" but patient has \"severe\"),\n   the criterion is NOT met \u2014 even if the general condition is present.\n3. CONTRADICTION CHECK: If the analysis conclusion (YES/NO) contradicts\n   its own reasoning text (e.g., says \"NO\" but the reasoning describes\n   the patient clearly having the condition), rely on the REASONING\n   CONTENT to determine the correct label. If genuinely ambiguous,\n   output \"unknown\".\n\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON:\n{\n  \"label\": \"<eligible|not eligible|unknown>\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of how you mapped the clinical finding to eligibility\",\n  \"evidence_sentences\": [0, 1, 2]\n}", "max_tokens_labeling": 256, "timeout_seconds": 300.0}}
