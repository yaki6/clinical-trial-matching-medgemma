Cohorts 3and3b: Participant must have progressed on or after osimertinib monotherapy as the most recent line of treatment. Osimertinib must have been administered as either the first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease or in the second-line setting after prior treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as a monotherapy. Cohort 4: Participants need to currently be on an amivantamab IV Q2W regimen (1,050 mg or 1,400 mg depending on weight) for at least 8 weeks, as part of standard of care, an expanded access program, or as a rollover from a long-term extension, without any amivantamab dose reduction. Cohort 7: Participants must have progressed on or after the combination of amivantamab and lazertinib as the most recent line of treatment.

If ROS1-Positive (Strong Possibility)**\n*   **Trial:** **TRIDENT-1: Repotrectinib in Patients with ROS1 or NTRK Fusions**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT03093116](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03093116)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** ROS1 fusions (highly enriched in never-smokers).\n    *   **Design:** The \"EXP-1\" cohort is specifically for **ROS1 TKI-na\u00efve** patients. Repotrectinib is a next-generation inhibitor with high efficacy against resistance mutations.\n    *   **Fit:** Ideal for a patient presenting with advanced stage disease who needs a durable first-line option.\n\n#### **3. If HER2-Mutated (Significant Possibility)**\n*   **Trial:** **Beamion LUNG-2: Zongertinib vs. Standard of Care in First-Line HER2+ NSCLC**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT06151574](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06151574)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** HER2 (ERBB2) mutations.\n    *   **Design:** Phase 3 trial comparing a specific HER2-targeted pill (Zongertinib) directly against standard chemo-immunotherapy.\n    *   **Fit:** HER2 mutations are a distinct driver in never-smokers. This trial offers access to targeted therapy in the first-line setting, which is not currently standard of care (usually chemo first).\n\n#### **4. If EGFR-Mutated (Most Common)**\n*   **Trial:** **Amivantamab and Lazertinib in EGFR-Mutated NSCLC (CHRYSALIS-2 / MARIPOSA)**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT05498428](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05498428)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** EGFR Exon 19 Deletion or L858R.\n    *   **Design:** Evaluates the chemo-free combination of a bispecific antibody (Amivantamab) and a TKI (Lazertinib).\n    *   **Fit:** Offers a potentially chemotherapy-sparing first-line option. (Note: Check specific cohort status as this is a large multi-cohort study).\n\n#### **5. If KRAS G12C-Mutated (Less common in never-smokers, but possible)**\n*   **Trial:** **CodeBreaK 202: Sotorasib vs. Standard of Care in First-Line KRAS G12C NSCLC**\n*   **NCT ID:** [NCT05920356](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05920356)\n*   **Why it's a top match:**\n    *   **Target:** KRAS G12C mutation.\n    *   **Design:** Phase 3 comparing the KRAS inhibitor Sotorasib + Chemo against standard Chemo + Pembrolizumab.\n    *   **Fit:** Provides access to targeted therapy upfront for KRAS G12C, which is otherwise treated with chemo-immunotherapy alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Next Steps**\n1.  **Molecular Testing is Urgent:** The \"Signet-ring\" histology and \"Never Smoker\" status make **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)** mandatory. You cannot choose a trial without knowing if she is `ALK+`, `ROS1+`, `EGFR+`, or `HER2+`.\n2.  **Brain MRI:** Many of these trials (especially ALK/ROS1) have specific inclusion criteria regarding brain metastases. A baseline MRI is essential.\n3.  **Confirm Stage:** The \"pleural fluid suspicious for malignancy\" needs to be confirmed (Stage IV) to be eligible for these metastatic trials."}}
